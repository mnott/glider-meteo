# Atmospheric Stability (StabilitÃ©/InstabilitÃ© de l'AtmosphÃ¨re)

**ðŸ“– Reference**: [Lesson 2 Slides - Stability](slides/meteo2_part-01-50.pdf#page=16)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Atmospheric stability is THE key to predicting soaring conditions:
- **Stable air** = no thermals = no soaring (except ridge/wave)
- **Unstable air** = thermals = great soaring!
- **Morning briefings** always discuss stability
- **Understanding stability** helps you predict when thermals will start/stop
- **Forecast interpretation** requires understanding stability concepts
- Stability determines whether you'll have a blue day, cu day, or no-fly day

## What Is Atmospheric Stability?

[Atmospheric stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_instability) describes whether the atmosphere **encourages or suppresses vertical motion**. In simple terms: will a rising thermal keep rising (unstable), or will it sink back down (stable)?

**Think of it like a ball on different surfaces** - this analogy perfectly captures the concept:

- **Stable** atmosphere: Ball in a bowl - if you push it up the side, it rolls back to the bottom (resists movement and returns to original position)
  - **For soaring**: Push some air upward, it becomes cooler than surroundings, gets heavy, sinks back down - NO THERMALS!

- **Unstable** atmosphere: Ball on top of a hill - if you nudge it even slightly, it rolls down and away, accelerating (encourages and amplifies movement)
  - **For soaring**: Push some air upward, it stays warmer than surroundings, gets more buoyant, accelerates upward - GREAT THERMALS!

- **Neutral** atmosphere: Ball on flat surface - stays wherever you put it, neither returns nor runs away
  - **For soaring**: Rare condition, weak thermals that neither strengthen nor die quickly

**Real-world analogy**: Think of a swimming pool. If you submerge a beach ball and let go (unstable - ball wants to rise), it shoots up and even jumps out of the water. If you try to push a rock upward underwater (stable - rock wants to sink), it falls back down as soon as you let go. Stability is about whether displaced air "wants" to keep moving or return to where it came from!

## The Two Key Factors

Stability depends on comparing TWO things:

### 1. Environmental Lapse Rate (Profil de TempÃ©rature)

This is the **actual temperature profile** of the atmosphere - how temperature changes with altitude in the ambient air around you. Think of it as the "background" temperature structure that your thermal is moving through.

**Measured by**:
- **Radiosondes** (weather balloons with instruments attached that measure temperature, pressure, and humidity as they ascend, transmitting data back to ground stations)
- **Soundings** (the graphical charts/data produced from radiosonde measurements, showing how temperature, dew point, and wind change with altitude)

**Can be anything**: Unlike the adiabatic rates (which are fixed at -1Â°C/100m and -0.6Â°C/100m), the environmental lapse rate varies tremendously:
- -0.3Â°C/100m (very shallow, stable)
- -0.7Â°C/100m (moderate)
- -1.2Â°C/100m (steep, very unstable!)
- +0.5Â°C/100m (temperature increasing with altitude - inversion!)
- It can even be different at different altitudes on the same day!

**Examples**:
- Morning: Often stable near surface (cool overnight)
- Afternoon: Often unstable (sun-heated surface)
- Under high pressure: Often very stable
- Ahead of cold front: Often very unstable

### 2. Parcel Lapse Rate (Adiabatiques)

This is how fast a **rising air parcel** would cool:
- **Dry**: -1Â°C/100m (below cloud base)
- **Saturated**: -0.6Â°C/100m (in cloud)

## Determining Stability

**The key comparison**: Is the rising thermal **warmer or cooler** than its surroundings?

### Unstable (Instable) - GOOD FOR SOARING!

**Definition**: Environmental lapse rate is **steeper** (more negative) than adiabatic rate

**What this means**: Rising air cools more slowly than the environment, so it stays warmer â†’ keeps rising!

**Example**:
- Environment cools at -1.2Â°C/100m (steep!)
- Dry parcel cools at -1.0Â°C/100m
- At 1000m: Environment = 10Â°C, Parcel = 12Â°C
- **Parcel is warmer** â†’ buoyant â†’ continues rising â†’ **THERMAL!**

**Signs of instability**:
- Cumulus clouds developing
- Dust devils forming
- Birds circling in thermals
- Good soaring conditions!

**Weather patterns**:
- Summer afternoons
- Cold air moving over warm surface
- Behind cold fronts
- Clear skies with strong surface heating

### Stable (Stable) - BAD FOR SOARING

**Definition**: Environmental lapse rate is **less steep** (less negative or even positive) than adiabatic rate

**What this means**: Rising air cools faster than environment, so it becomes cooler â†’ sinks back down!

**Example**:
- Environment cools at -0.5Â°C/100m (gentle)
- Dry parcel cools at -1.0Â°C/100m
- At 1000m: Environment = 17Â°C, Parcel = 15Â°C
- **Parcel is cooler** â†’ not buoyant â†’ sinks â†’ **NO THERMALS**

**Signs of stability**:
- Stratus layers
- Haze trapped near surface
- Fog
- Smooth, laminar air
- No thermal soaring!

**Weather patterns**:
- High pressure systems
- Morning before surface heating
- Warm air moving over cold surface
- Temperature inversions

### Temperature Inversion (Inversion de TempÃ©rature)

**Definition**: Temperature **increases** with altitude (positive lapse rate!)

**What this means**: Extremely stable! Rising air encounters warmer air above â†’ immediately becomes cooler than surroundings â†’ strong suppression of vertical motion.

**Effects**:
- **Caps thermal development** - thermals can't penetrate
- Traps pollution/haze below
- Creates cloud "streets" if thermals can break through
- Morning inversions delay thermal onset

**Types**:
- **Surface inversion**: Forms overnight (radiative cooling)
- **Subsidence inversion**: From descending air in high pressure
- **Frontal inversion**: Warm air overriding cold air

**For pilots**:
- Morning: Wait for sun to "break" the inversion
- Watch for temperature to exceed inversion temperature
- First thermals often strong after inversion breaks!

## Visualizing Stability

On a temperature-altitude diagram:

```
Altitude â†‘
         |
         |  Environmental profile (actual air)
         |  Adiabatic lines (rising parcel)
         |
         |_______________â†’ Temperature
```

**Unstable**: Environmental line leans LEFT (steep) compared to adiabatic

**Stable**: Environmental line leans RIGHT (shallow) or vertical (inversion)

## Conditional Instability

**Special case**: Air is stable when dry, but unstable once saturated!

**How it works**:
1. Environment cools at -0.7Â°C/100m
2. Dry parcel cools at -1.0Â°C/100m â†’ **Stable** (parcel cooling faster)
3. But saturated parcel cools at -0.6Â°C/100m â†’ **Unstable!** (parcel cooling slower)

**What this means**:
- Need a "trigger" to lift air to condensation level
- Once clouds form, strong convection develops
- **Result**: Big cu or even cumulonimbus!

**Common trigger mechanisms**:
- Mountain uplift
- Frontal lift
- Convergence zones
- Strong surface heating

**For pilots**: This is why some days "explode" once clouds start forming!

## Factors Affecting Stability

### 1. Surface Heating

**Morning**: Cool surface â†’ stable
**Afternoon**: Hot surface â†’ unstable

**Process**:
- Sun heats ground
- Ground heats lowest air layer
- Creates steep lapse rate near surface
- Instability develops from ground up

**For pilots**: Thermal activity follows sun - watch for surface temp to climb!

### 2. Cold Air Aloft

**Cold air moving over region** = increasing instability

**Why**: If cold air arrives aloft while surface stays warm â†’ very steep lapse rate â†’ strong instability â†’ excellent thermals!

**Signs**: Post-frontal conditions, northerly flow, clear air aloft

### 3. Warm Air Advection

**Warm air moving over region** = increasing stability

**Why**: Warm air aloft, cooler surface â†’ shallow lapse rate â†’ stability

**Signs**: Southerly flow (in Northern Hemisphere), overcast, poor lift

### 4. Moisture Content

**Higher humidity** = easier to trigger instability

**Why**: Lowers cloud base, allows parcels to benefit from latent heat release sooner

**Dry air**: Thermals must overcome stability while dry (-1Â°C/100m)

**Moist air**: Thermals get latent heat boost sooner (-0.6Â°C/100m)

## Practical Assessment for Pilots

### Morning Weather Check

**Look at sounding (if available)**:
- Steep lapse rate aloft? â†’ Good!
- Inversion present? â†’ When will it break?
- Moisture? â†’ Cloud base prediction

**Check forecast**:
- Max temperature prediction
- Boundary layer depth
- Lifted index, CAPE (for powered pilots/paragliders)

### At the Airfield

**Good signs (unstable)**:
- Cu forming and growing
- Dust devils
- Wind sock fluctuating
- Hawks/eagles circling
- Visible heat shimmer

**Bad signs (stable)**:
- Stratus deck
- Hazy, smooth air
- Flags hanging limp
- Smoke rising straight up then spreading (inversion!)

### During Flight

**Unstable conditions**:
- Strong, well-defined thermals
- Cumulus marking lift
- Good climbs to high altitude
- Active convection

**Stable conditions**:
- Weak, broken thermals
- Difficult to center
- Low cloudbase or no clouds
- Smooth sink everywhere

## Questions & Answers

### Q16 Context: Devenir de la bulle d'air?
**English**: What determines what happens to an air bubble?

**RÃ©ponse (FR)**: Le devenir de la bulle d'air dÃ©pend de deux facteurs:
- Le profil de tempÃ©rature de l'atmosphÃ¨re (gradient environnemental)
- L'humiditÃ© de la bulle (dÃ©termine si elle suit le gradient sec ou saturÃ©)

**Answer (EN)**: The fate of the air bubble depends on two factors:
- The temperature profile of the atmosphere (environmental lapse rate)
- The humidity of the bubble (determines if it follows dry or saturated gradient)

**Explanation**: If the bubble is **warmer** than surrounding air at the same altitude â†’ it's less dense â†’ it continues rising (UNSTABLE). If it's **cooler** â†’ it's more dense â†’ it sinks back down (STABLE).

The humidity matters because it determines which adiabatic rate applies:
- **Dry bubble** (RH < 100%): cools at -1Â°C/100m
- **Saturated bubble** (RH = 100%, cloud): cools at -0.6Â°C/100m

This is why some thermals only work after cloud base - the latent heat release makes them warmer than the environment!
