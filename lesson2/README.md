## Key Concepts for Glider Pilots

### The Three Critical Numbers

1. **-1°C/100m**: Dry adiabatic lapse rate (below cloud base)
2. **-0.6°C/100m**: Saturated adiabatic lapse rate (in clouds)
3. **Cloud base = (T - Td) / 0.8 × 100m**: Predicting condensation level

### The Thermal Process

```
Sun → Ground heating → Conduction → Thermal bubble →
→ Adiabatic cooling (-1°C/100m) → Reach dew point →
→ Cloud forms → Latent heat released → Stronger thermal (-0.6°C/100m)
```

### Reading the Sky

**Good soaring signs**:
- Growing cumulus clouds (convective activity)
- High dew point spread (high cloud base, blue thermals)
- Small dew point spread (low cloud base, marked thermals)

**Poor soaring signs**:
- Stratus layers (stable air)
- Temperature inversion (capped convection)
- Overcast (surface cooling, no thermals)

## Practical Applications

### Morning Weather Brief

Check these parameters:
1. **T and Td spread**: Predicts cloud base
2. **Max temperature forecast**: Thermal strength
3. **Stability profile**: Thermal tops
4. **Cloud forecast**: Soarable or not?

### Predicting Cloud Base

**Example**:
- 0900 surface temp: 15°C
- 0900 dew point: 7°C
- Spread: 8°C
- Expected cloud base: (8 / 0.8) × 100 = **1000m AGL**

### Understanding Thermal Strength

**Below cloud base** (dry):
- Thermal cools at -1°C/100m
- Moderate strength

**In cloud** (saturated):
- Thermal cools at -0.6°C/100m
- **Latent heat released → stronger lift!**
- This is why you often feel a "kick" at cloud base

## Connection to Other Lessons

**From Lesson 1**:
- Atmospheric structure (troposphere = our domain)
- Temperature, pressure, density relationships
- Wind basics (thermals are vertical winds!)

**To Lesson 3** (Future):
- Air masses and fronts
- Climatology
- Aviation hazards
- Meteorological information

## Study Tips

1. **Memorize the key numbers**: -1, -0.6, 0.8 (for cloud base)
2. **Understand WHY, not just WHAT**: Why does saturated air cool slower? (Latent heat!)
3. **Practice calculations**: Use morning METAR to predict cloud base
4. **Observe and identify**: Look at sky, practice cloud identification
5. **Connect theory to experience**: Next flight, predict your cloud base before launching!

## Questions Covered

Lesson 2 addresses Q&A questions 1-17 from the meteo2_qa file:
- Q1-3, 11: Phase changes and latent heat
- Q4-7: Humidity concepts
- Q8-10, 12-13: Adiabatic processes
- Q14: Thermal formation
- Q15-16: Cloud identification

## Advanced Topics (Part 2)

### Cloud Identification Mastery

**Development sequence**:
```
Cu humilis (pancake) → Cu mediocris (equal H/W) →
→ Cu congestus (tower) → Cumulonimbus (anvil)
```

**Safety progression**:
- Cu hum/med: Safe, good soaring
- Congestus: Strong lift BUT watch for Cb development
- Cb: **AVOID BY 20+ KM - DEADLY**

### Fog Decision Making

**Morning briefing checklist**:
1. Check T-Td spread (< 3°C → fog likely)
2. Forecast dissipation time
3. Consider valley vs. ridge launch
4. Plan for delayed thermal onset

**Evening safety**:
- Watch for rapid fog formation (30 min!)
- Land BEFORE fog forms
- Monitor visibility trend

### Precipitation and Flight Ops

**Decision matrix**:
- Light (`-RA`): Caution, land if worsening
- Moderate (`RA`): Land immediately
- Heavy (`+RA`): Emergency - land now
- Convective (`SH`): Avoid by 10+ km
- Cb-related: Avoid by 20+ km
