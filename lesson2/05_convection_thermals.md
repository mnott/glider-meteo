# Convection and Thermals (Convection et Ascendances Thermiques)

**üìñ Reference**: [Lesson 2 Slides - Convection](slides/meteo2_part-01-50.pdf#page=18)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Convection IS gliding - without it, no thermal soaring exists:
- **Thermals are convection** - rising air from surface heating
- **Understanding the process** helps you find and predict thermals
- **Daily thermal cycle** follows convection development
- **Trigger points** and thermal sources make sense when you understand convection
- **Cloud streets, convergence lines** are organized convection
- Mastering convection theory makes you a better cross-country pilot

## What Is Convection?

[Convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection) is the **vertical transport of heat through air movement**.

**Three ways heat moves**:
1. **Conduction**: Heat transfer through direct contact (like touching a hot stove - the heat moves from the stove into your hand by molecular contact)
2. **Radiation**: Heat transfer through electromagnetic waves without any material medium (like feeling the sun's warmth on your face - the energy travels through empty space)
3. **Convection**: Heat transfer by physically moving the warm substance itself (like a hot air balloon rising - the warm air carries its heat with it as it moves)

Unlike conduction (which is slow in air) or radiation (which mainly heats surfaces), convection physically moves warm air parcels upward and cool air parcels downward, creating vertical circulation.

**For pilots**: Convection = thermals = lift = soaring! Every time you circle in a thermal, you're riding a convection current.

**Real-world example**: Boiling water in a pot demonstrates convection perfectly. Hot water at the bottom becomes less dense and rises to the top, while cooler water at the top sinks to the bottom, creating a circulation pattern. Thermals work exactly the same way, just in air instead of water!

## The Thermal Engine - Step by Step

### Step 1: The Energy Source - Solar Radiation

**The sun is the engine** (Moteur: √©nergie solaire)

- Solar radiation travels through atmosphere (transparent to sunlight)
- Reaches Earth's surface
- Ground absorbs energy and heats up
- Different surfaces heat at different rates (more on this below)

**What this means**: Without sun, no thermals! Cloudy days, winter, late afternoon ‚Üí weaker solar heating ‚Üí weaker or no thermals.

### Step 2: Ground Heats the Air - Conduction

**Surface temperatures rise** (¬∞C sol)

- Ground becomes hotter than air above it
- Thin layer of air directly touching ground heats by **conduction** (direct contact)
- Only affects bottom few centimeters/meters of air
- Creates super-heated air layer in contact with surface

**What this means**: The ground can be 40-50¬∞C on a hot day while air at 2m is only 25-30¬∞C. This temperature difference is the "fuel" for thermals.

### Step 3: Trigger - Air Parcels Form (For√ßage - Bulles)

**Thermal bubbles detach** (Bulles)

Not all surfaces heat equally. Hot spots develop over:
- Dark surfaces (asphalt, plowed fields)
- Rocky slopes
- Buildings
- Cleared areas

Air at these spots becomes much warmer than surroundings ‚Üí creates buoyant parcels that eventually detach and rise (like bubbles in boiling water).

**Triggers**:
- Differential heating
- Wind convergence
- Obstacles (buildings, trees)
- Terrain features

### Step 4: Rising Through Convection

**Thermal ascends** (Convection)

Once detached, the warm bubble:
- Rises through cooler surrounding air (buoyancy - like a hot air balloon!)
- Draws more warm air from below ‚Üí continuous thermal column
- Expands as pressure decreases (d√©tente)
- Cools adiabatically at -1¬∞C/100m (dry) or -0.6¬∞C/100m (saturated)

**What this means**: This is your thermal! A continuous circulation:
- Warm air rises in the core
- Cool air descends around it (sink between thermals)
- More warm air drawn in at the bottom

### Step 5: Cloud Formation (if humid enough)

**Condensation level reached** (Niveau de condensation - Td)

- Rising air reaches dew point temperature
- Water vapor condenses ‚Üí visible cloud (cumulus!)
- Latent heat released ‚Üí thermal strengthens
- Cooling rate slows from -1¬∞C to -0.6¬∞C/100m
- Cloud marks thermal location - easy to find!

**What this means**: Cloud base is NOT random - it's precisely where T = Td. This is why morning dew point readings predict afternoon cloud base!

## The Complete Cycle

```
Surface ‚Üí Conduction ‚Üí Bubble forms ‚Üí Convection rises ‚Üí Expansion/cooling ‚Üí Cloud (if humid)
  ‚Üë                                            ‚Üì
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Cool air sinks around thermal ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

## Thermal Characteristics

### Condensation Level (Niveau de Condensation)

**Where cloud base forms**:
- Altitude where T = Td
- Marks transition from dry to saturated adiabatic
- Calculated from surface T-Td spread
- Typical Swiss summer: 1500-2500m AGL

**Importance**:
- Thermals easier to find (marked by clouds)
- Thermal strength increases (latent heat)
- Provides visual feedback of thermal organization

### Convective Layer (Tranche Convective)

**The depth of thermal activity**:
- From surface to thermal tops
- Can be 1000m (weak day) to 4000m+ (strong day)
- Determined by stability aloft and surface heating
- Deeper = better cross-country potential

**Indicators**:
- Cu tops show approximate thermal ceiling
- Soundings predict maximum depth
- Inversions can cap the layer

### Without Cumulus - Blue Thermals

**"Blue day" or "thermique pur"**

Occurs when:
- Air is very dry (low dew point)
- Cloud base above thermal tops
- Air too dry to reach saturation

**Challenges**:
- No visual thermal markers
- Must use other cues (terrain, birds, experience)
- Thermals may be less organized
- Weaker climbs (no latent heat boost)

**Advantages**:
- No cloud shadows killing thermals
- Can fly higher (no cloud restrictions)
- Often stronger surface heating (clear skies)

**Finding blue thermals**:
- Observe terrain (thermal triggers)
- Watch for terrain-shadow lift transition
- Look for birds, dust devils
- Note areas of lift on previous passes
- Use instruments (air mass changes)

## Thermal Trigger Sources

### Best Thermal Sources

**Low albedo (dark surfaces, absorb heat)**:

*Note: "Albedo" means reflectivity. LOW albedo = dark = absorbs heat. HIGH albedo = light/white = reflects heat.*

- **Plowed fields** (dark soil) - Can reach 50-60¬∞C on sunny days! Much hotter than surrounding green fields
- **Asphalt parking lots** - Classic thermal trigger, often 20-30¬∞C hotter than grass nearby
- **Rocky areas** - Especially dark rocks like basalt or slate
- **Cities/buildings** - Urban heat island effect, roofs and streets absorb massive amounts of heat
- **South-facing slopes** (in Northern Hemisphere) - Receive more direct sunlight throughout the day

**Real-world example**: On a hot day, walk barefoot from grass to asphalt parking lot - you'll immediately feel the temperature difference! The asphalt might be 50¬∞C while grass is only 30¬∞C. That 20¬∞C difference is what creates the thermal trigger.

**Terrain features**:
- Ridge convergence
- Valley floor centers
- Isolated hills
- Forest clearings

### Poor Thermal Sources

**Low albedo (light, reflects heat)**:
- Snow fields
- Lakes/water bodies
- Dense forests
- Wet surfaces

**Why water is poor**:
- High heat capacity (heats slowly)
- Evaporative cooling
- Often a sink area!

## Finding and Using Thermals

### Visual Clues (with cumulus)

**Best indicator**: Active cumulus clouds
- Growing cu = active thermal
- Flat top = mature, weakening
- Ragged edges = dissipating
- Dark base = strong core

**Cumulus life cycle**:
1. Small wisps forming (thermal starting)
2. Growing cauliflower (strong thermal)
3. Flat top (mature, reaching stable layer)
4. Ragged, dissipating (thermal dying)

**Strategy**: Fly toward forming/growing cu, avoid dissipating

### Visual Clues (blue days)

**Terrain**:
- Dark surfaces
- South-facing slopes (Northern Hemisphere)
- Avoid lakes, forests

**Natural indicators**:
- Dust devils
- Birds circling
- Smoke patterns
- Haze patterns

**Shadow patterns**:
- Thermals often at sun-shade boundaries
- Mountains create thermal triggers

### Temporal Patterns

**Daily cycle**:
- 0800-1000: Inversion breaking, weak thermals starting
- 1000-1200: Thermals strengthening, becoming organized
- 1200-1500: Peak thermal activity
- 1500-1700: Starting to weaken
- 1700+: Dying, dangerous to be far from field!

**Seasonal**:
- Summer: Strong, late (long days)
- Spring/Fall: Moderate, earlier end
- Winter: Weak or absent (low sun angle)

## Factors Limiting Convection

### 1. Lack of Surface Heating

**Causes**:
- Cloud cover (blocks sun)
- Late afternoon (sun angle)
- Cold surfaces (snow, frozen ground)

**Effect**: No thermals form

**For pilots**: Check cloud forecast - extensive cu can shade surface and kill thermals!

### 2. Stable Layer Aloft

**Inversion or very stable layer**:
- Acts as "lid" on convection
- Thermals can't penetrate
- Creates flat-topped cu
- Limited thermal height

**Effect**: Low thermal tops, limited cross-country

**For pilots**: Check soundings for capping inversions

### 3. Wind

**Moderate wind** (5-15 kt):
- Good: Organizes thermals
- Creates cloud streets
- Makes thermals lean/drift
- Provides ridge/convergence lift

**Strong wind** (>20 kt):
- Bad: Breaks up thermals
- Makes centering difficult
- Can suppress convection
- But may provide wave/ridge lift

**For pilots**: Some wind is good, too much is bad for thermal soaring

## Questions & Answers

### Q14: Une ascendance est g√©n√©r√©e
**English**: A thermal is generated

- A) gr√¢ce au soleil qui chauffe directement l'air pr√®s du sol
- B) par le rayonnement du sol
- C) **par la chaleur transf√©r√©e par conduction du sol √† l'air** ‚úì
- D) de nuit comme de jour

**R√©ponse (FR)**: C) par la chaleur transf√©r√©e par conduction du sol √† l'air

**Answer (EN)**: C) by heat transferred by conduction from the ground to the air

**Explanation**: This is a critical distinction:

1. **Sun does NOT directly heat air** (A is wrong): Air is transparent to sunlight. Solar radiation passes through and heats the GROUND.

2. **Ground radiation is infrared** (B is incomplete): The ground does radiate, but this heats the air mainly by warming it from below.

3. **Conduction creates the hot bubble** (C is CORRECT): The ground heats up, then the lowest layer of air heats by direct contact (conduction). This creates the initial warm bubble that then rises by convection.

4. **Not at night** (D is wrong): Night convection can occur (like thunderstorms), but daytime thermals specifically need solar heating.

**Sequence**: Sun ‚Üí Ground ‚Üí Conduction ‚Üí Warm air bubble ‚Üí Convection (thermal!)

Without conduction heating the air at the surface, there would be no buoyant air parcels to rise!
