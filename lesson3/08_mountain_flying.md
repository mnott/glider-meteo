# Mountain Flying (Vol en montagne)

## Overview
Mountain flying presents unique meteorological hazards due to terrain interaction with wind, temperature variations with altitude, and reduced air density. Understanding these phenomena is essential for safe Alpine gliding operations.

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Mountains create specific hazards:
- **Turbulence and rotors** can overstress aircraft or cause loss of control
- **Clouds merging with terrain** eliminate visual references
- **Rapid weather changes** due to orographic effects
- **Reduced air density** at altitude affects performance
- **Cold temperatures** increase physiological risks
- **Limited landing options** - mostly mountain airstrips

**Slide 81**: Shows typical Alpine flying conditions with turbulence risks and clouds near terrain

## Primary Hazards

### 1. Turbulence (Turbulences)

**Sources in Mountains:**

**Mechanical Turbulence:**
- Wind flowing over/around peaks creates eddies and rotors
- Strongest on leeward side of ridges
- Intensity increases with wind speed
- Can extend several kilometers downwind

**Mountain Waves** (Slide 82):
- Atmospheric oscillation downwind of mountain barriers
- Creates alternating areas of lift and sink
- **Rotors** beneath wave crests - violent rotating air masses
- Can extend to 50,000+ ft altitude
- Lenticular clouds mark wave crests

**Thermal Turbulence:**
- Sunlit slopes generate strong, narrow thermals
- Release irregularly - gusty conditions
- Combined with orographic effects creates complex air currents

**Lee Turbulence (Slide 83):**
- Image shows dramatic rotor cloud formation (Jungfrau mountain)
- Indicates severe turbulence in that area
- Visual warning to avoid leeward slopes in strong wind

**What this means**: Mountains don't just obstruct wind - they create a complex three-dimensional pattern of rising and sinking air, often with violent turbulence. Slides 82-83 show the dramatic cloud formations that warn of these conditions.

**Recognition and Avoidance:**
- Lenticular clouds = wave activity present
- Cap clouds on peaks = strong wind over summit
- Ragged, torn clouds = turbulence
- Smooth, lens-shaped clouds = wave (still turbulent below)
- Avoid leeward slopes in strong wind (>15 kt)
- Maintain extra speed margin when turbulence expected
- Be prepared for sudden altitude changes

### 2. Clouds Near Terrain (NÃ©bulositÃ© proche du relief)

**Hazards:**

**Orographic Clouds** (Slide 84):
- Form when moist air is forced up windward slopes
- Cloud base can be AT terrain level
- Creates IMC conditions even with CAVOK report at valley airports
- Peaks disappear into clouds

**Dynamic Clouds:**
- Wave clouds (lenticular)
- Cap clouds
- Rotor clouds
- Can form/dissipate rapidly

**Limited Visibility:**
- Difficult to judge distance to terrain in haze/clouds
- "White room" effect in clouds - no depth perception
- Shadows and terrain features essential for visual references

**Safety Rules:**
- Maintain VFR cloud clearance (in sight of surface)
- Never enter clouds in mountains - terrain collision risk
- Have escape route if clouds lower
- Know minimum safe altitudes for area

### 3. Altitude Effects (Effets de l'altitude)

**Reduced Air Density:**

**Aircraft Performance** (Slide 85 - left image shows instruments):
- True airspeed higher than indicated for same lift coefficient
- Longer takeoff/landing distance
- Reduced climb performance
- Wider turn radius at given bank angle
- Variometer shows lower climb rates (indicated vs true)

**What this means**: At 10,000 ft, your true airspeed is ~15% higher than indicated, your stall speed occurs at a higher indicated speed, and your turn radius is larger. Plan accordingly!

**Physiological Effects:**

**Hypoxia** (lack of oxygen):
- Noticeable effects start ~8,000-10,000 ft for most people
- Symptoms: fatigue, reduced judgment, slower reactions, euphoria, headache
- Individual variation - some affected lower
- Worsened by: cold, fatigue, illness, alcohol (even previous day)
- Insidious - you don't recognize it affecting you

**Cold Exposure** (Slide 85 - right image shows warm clothing):
- Temperature decreases ~2Â°C per 1,000 ft (~0.6Â°C/100m)
- At 10,000 ft, can be 20Â°C+ colder than valley
- Wind chill in open cockpit
- Cold affects: judgment, dexterity, endurance

**Protection Measures:**
- **Warm clothing** - layers, gloves, hat (Slide 85 shows pilots in winter gear)
- **Oxygen** - consider for flights >10,000 ft, required >12,500 ft (US regs)
- **Hydration** - dehydration worsens altitude effects
- **Self-monitoring** - watch for hypoxia symptoms
- **Know your limits** - altitude tolerance varies by individual and day

### 4. Weather Variability

**Rapid Changes:**
- Valley breezes change direction twice daily
- Clouds form/dissipate on schedule
- Afternoon thunderstorm development
- Foehn onset/cessation can be sudden

**Microclimate Effects:**
- Sunny vs. shaded slopes differ by 10Â°C+
- Valley inversions trap cold air and fog
- Different weather each valley/slope

**Planning Implications:**
- Weather forecast is general - local effects dominate
- Timing critical - good morning conditions may be bad afternoon
- Local knowledge invaluable

## Foehn Conditions (Covered in [Alpine Weather](05_alpine_weather_situations.md))

**Extreme Turbulence:**
- Mountain wave rotors
- Severe turbulence downwind of peaks
- Strong, gusty winds in valleys
- Generally no-fly conditions for gliders

## Mountain Wave Soaring

**Opportunities:**
- High altitudes possible
- Long flights along wave systems
- Can reach stratosphere

**Risks:**
- Severe turbulence in/near rotors
- Rapid altitude changes (Â±10 m/s)
- Risk of hypoxia at high altitudes
- Can be trapped above clouds
- Oxygen required for high flights

## Decision Making for Mountain Flying

**Pre-Flight Assessment:**
- Wind speed and direction at mountain level
- Freezing level and cloud forecast
- Visibility and cloud base
- Stability - will afternoon Cu build to Cb?
- Local effects - foehn, valley winds

**In Flight:**
- Continuous weather monitoring
- Cloud development - building or dissipating?
- Wind changes - strengthening or weakening?
- Have "out" option - can you get back to valley?
- Altitude awareness - performance and physiology

**When to Avoid Mountain Flying:**
- Strong wind (>25 kt) perpendicular to ridges
- Foehn conditions
- Cloud bases at or below peak altitudes
- Thunderstorms forecast
- Limited experience + challenging conditions

## Summary

**Key Principles:**
- Mountains create turbulence - expect it and maintain speed margin
- Clouds + mountains = danger - stay VMC with clear escape route
- Altitude affects both aircraft and pilot - dress warmly, consider oxygen
- Weather changes rapidly - continuous monitoring essential
- Local knowledge crucial - learn from experienced mountain pilots
- Conservative decision making - respect the mountains

**The Rule**: Never fly into IMC in mountains. Always have an out.
