# Icing and Freezing (Givrage et gel)

## Overview
[Aircraft icing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_icing) occurs when supercooled water droplets freeze on contact with aircraft surfaces. For gliders, icing is extremely dangerous as it destroys the aerodynamic profile, increases weight, and can make the aircraft uncontrollable.

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

- **Gliders have no de-icing equipment** - unlike many powered aircraft
- **Laminar airfoils extremely sensitive** - even small amounts of ice destroy performance
- **Loss of lift** and increased drag can make glider unsinkable
- **Control surface icing** can jam controls or cause flutter
- **Canopy icing** blocks visibility
- **Pitot/static icing** gives false airspeed/altitude readings
- **Cannot "climb above" or "divert with power"** - you must deal with it immediately

**Critical**: Icing can develop within minutes and transform a controllable glider into an uncontrollable falling object. Without de-icing equipment, gliders have no defense against ice accumulation - avoidance is the ONLY strategy.

## Types of Ice

### 1. Clear Ice (Givre transparent / Verglas)

**Formation:**
- **Large supercooled water droplets** (typically in cumuliform clouds or freezing rain)
- Temperature: 0Â°C to -10Â°C
- Droplets spread before freezing, creating smooth, transparent ice layer

**Characteristics:**
- **Most dangerous type** - very dense, adheres strongly
- Hard to see - transparent
- Difficult to remove
- Heavy
- Forms smooth profile initially, but quickly builds up

**Where Found:**
- Cumuliform clouds (Cu, Cb) with temperatures slightly below 0Â°C
- Freezing rain or drizzle
- High liquid water content areas

### 2. Rime Ice (Givre blanc)

**Formation:**
- **Small supercooled water droplets** (typically in stratiform clouds)
- Temperature: -10Â°C to -20Â°C
- Droplets freeze instantly on contact, trapping air

**Characteristics:**
- White, opaque, milky appearance
- Rough, granular surface
- Lighter than clear ice but still serious
- Easier to see
- Destroys laminar flow immediately

**Where Found:**
- Stratiform clouds (St, Sc) at cold temperatures
- Forms more slowly than clear ice

### 3. Mixed Ice (Givre mixte)

**Combination of clear and rime ice** - characteristics between the two types.

## Ground Icing

### [Frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost) (Gel blanc / GelÃ©e blanche)

**Formation:**
- Clear, calm nights with high humidity
- Aircraft surface cools below 0Â°C
- Water vapor directly deposits as ice crystals on surface

**Danger:**
- Even thin frost layer destroys laminar flow
- Can prevent aircraft from flying at all
- **Must be completely removed before flight**
- Cannot be removed by "flying through it" or waiting for sun

## Where Icing Occurs

### Temperature and Altitude

**Icing Zone** (slide 78):
- **Glider at altitude below 0Â°C** (typically between 0Â°C and -40Â°C)
- Below 0Â°C isotherm: Liquid water (no icing risk from droplets)
- 0Â°C to -40Â°C: **Icing risk zone** - supercooled water can exist
- Below -40Â°C: Too cold for supercooled water - ice crystals only (no icing risk)

**What this means**: The dangerous icing zone is where water is cold enough to be supercooled but warm enough to still be liquid. This is typically between 0Â°C and -20Â°C, with maximum risk near 0Â°C to -10Â°C.

### Cloud Types and Icing

**High Risk:**
- **Cumuliform clouds** (Cu, TCu, Cb) - large droplets, high liquid water content
- **Freezing rain/drizzle** - extremely dangerous, immediate heavy icing
- Clouds with temperatures 0Â°C to -10Â°C

**Moderate Risk:**
- Stratiform clouds at -10Â°C to -20Â°C
- Wave clouds (lenticularis)

**Low Risk:**
- Cirrus and other ice-crystal only clouds (too cold)
- Clouds warmer than +5Â°C (no supercooled water)

### Frontal Icing (Slide 79)

**Warm Front Scenario:**
- Warm air mass overriding cold air
- Rain from warm air falls through cold air below
- **Freezing rain** develops if surface temperature < 0Â°C
- Extremely dangerous - rapid severe icing

**What this means**: The combination of cold air at your altitude and warm rain from above creates ideal icing conditions. Stay on the ground!

## Recognizing Icing Conditions

**Before Flight - Weather Analysis:**
- Temperature at altitude: Is it between 0Â°C and -20Â°C?
- Forecast for clouds in that temperature range?
- Frontal systems approaching?
- Freezing level altitude

**In Flight - Visual Clues:**
- Temperature gauge showing 0Â°C to -10Â°C
- Visible moisture (clouds, rain, drizzle)
- Frost/ice forming on canopy frame, leading edges, or pitot
- White streaks appearing on wings

**First Signs of Icing:**
1. Ice on windscreen or canopy frame
2. Ice on wing leading edges (look at wing root, visible from cockpit)
3. Degraded performance - higher sink rate
4. Control responses feel different
5. False airspeed indications (pitot icing)

## Avoiding Icing

**Pre-Flight:**
- **Check freezing level** in weather forecast
- **Plan to stay below 0Â°C isotherm** if clouds present
- **Don't fly if fronts with freezing rain forecast**
- Remove all frost before flight

**In Flight:**
- **Stay in clear air** - avoid clouds if temperature < 0Â°C
- **Descend immediately** if you encounter icing
- **Exit clouds** as soon as icing detected
- Head toward warmer air (lower altitude, or away from cold front)

**If You Encounter Icing:**
1. **Exit the icing condition IMMEDIATELY** - don't wait to see if it gets worse
2. **Descend** to warmer temperatures (if terrain permits)
3. **Increase airspeed** slightly - helps prevent stall with contaminated airfoil
4. **Land ASAP** - don't try to continue flying
5. **Avoid steep turns or slow flight** - reduces stall margin

## Special Cases

### Freezing Rain (Pluie verglaÃ§ante)

**Most dangerous icing situation:**
- Blog post referenced on slide 80: December 13-14, 2022 event in Switzerland
- Rapid accumulation of clear ice
- Can accumulate faster than you can descend
- **DO NOT FLY** when freezing rain is forecast or occurring

**Synoptic Setup** (slide 80 example):
- Cold air trapped at surface (high pressure)
- Warm, moist air overriding (from warm sector)
- Rain falls from warm layer into cold layer
- "Warm tongue" on upper air chart over cold surface air

### Carb Icing (for powered aircraft)

Not applicable to gliders, but important for tow planes and motor gliders.

## Performance Impacts

**Even Small Amounts:**
- **Drag increase** of 50-200%
- **Lift reduction** of 30%+
- **Stall speed increase** of 10-20%
- **Weight increase**
- **Control effectiveness reduction**

**What this means**: A glider that accumulates even small amounts of ice may be unable to maintain altitude even in thermals, and will have a much higher stall speed - potentially above normal approach speed.

## Summary

**Key Principles:**
- Gliders have ZERO ice protection - avoidance is the only option
- Icing can develop in minutes - be proactive
- If temperature < 0Â°C and visible moisture present: HIGH RISK
- First sign of icing = immediate action to exit conditions
- Freezing rain = DO NOT FLY
- Remove all frost before flight

**The Rule**: Never intentionally fly in clouds when temperature is between +5Â°C and -20Â°C. If you encounter icing, exit immediately.
