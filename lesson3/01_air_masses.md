# Air Masses

## Overview
An [air mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass) is a large body of air with relatively uniform temperature and humidity characteristics throughout. Air masses form when air stagnates over a region long enough to acquire the thermal and moisture properties of that surface.

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Understanding air masses is fundamental because:
- **Air mass properties determine weather**: The temperature and humidity of an air mass directly affect cloud formation, stability, and soaring conditions
- **Air mass boundaries create fronts**: Where different air masses meet, fronts form - bringing significant weather changes
- **Trajectory matters**: As an air mass moves, it can be modified (humidified, dried, warmed, cooled), changing the weather it brings
- **Predicting conditions**: Knowing the source region helps predict what weather to expect

## Classification of Air Masses

Air masses are classified by their **source region** (latitude) and **surface type** (maritime vs. continental).

### By Latitude (Temperature)

Air masses are classified into 4 categories based on their source latitude:

#### 1. [Arctic Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_air) - Air arctique / masse d'air arctique
- **Source**: North Pole region (above 70Â°N)
- **Characteristics**: Extremely cold, very dry
- **Rare in Switzerland**: Can occasionally reach us in winter
- **Effect**: Bitter cold, clear skies if continental; snow showers if maritime

####  2. [Polar Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_air_mass) - Air polaire / masse d'air polaire
- **Source**: 50Â°-70Â° latitude (Northern Europe, Russia, Canada)
- **Characteristics**: Cold, moderate humidity
- **Common in Switzerland**: Especially in winter and spring
- **Effect**: Cool temperatures, often unstable if heated from below

#### 3. [Tropical Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_air_mass) - Air tropical / masse d'air tropical
- **Source**: 20Â°-40Â° latitude (Mediterranean, North Africa, southern US)
- **Characteristics**: Warm to hot, variable humidity
- **Common in Switzerland**: Summer, sometimes spring/autumn
- **Effect**: Warm weather, can be stable or unstable depending on moisture

#### 4. Equatorial Air - Air Ã©quatorial / masse d'air Ã©quatorial
- **Source**: Equatorial regions (0Â°-20Â°)
- **Characteristics**: Very warm, very humid
- **Rare in Switzerland**: Only reaches us occasionally in summer
- **Effect**: Hot, humid, often unstable with thunderstorm potential

### By Surface Type (Humidity)

The surface over which an air mass forms determines its moisture content:

#### Maritime - Maritime
- **Forms over**: Oceans and seas - mer/ocÃ©an
- **Characteristics**: High humidity, tends to form clouds and fog
- **Symbol**: 'm' (e.g., mP = maritime Polar)
- **Effect for Switzerland**:
  - **From west** (Atlantic): Humid, clouds, precipitation
  - **From south** (Mediterranean): Warm and humid

#### Continental - Continental
- **Forms over**: Land masses - continent
- **Characteristics**: Lower humidity, clearer skies
- **Symbol**: 'c' (e.g., cP = continental Polar)
- **Effect for Switzerland**:
  - **From east** (Eastern Europe/Russia): Dry, often stable in winter (cold), potentially unstable in summer (hot)

## Air Mass Modification

As an air mass moves from its source region, it undergoes **modification** - changes in temperature and/or humidity due to interaction with the surface below.

### 1. Maritime Trajectory - Trajet maritime
**Process**: Air mass moves over water (ocean/sea)

**Effect**: **Humidification** - Humidification
- Water evaporates into the air mass
- Humidity increases
- Low clouds and fog can form (Stratocumulus, Stratus)
- Example: Polar air moving south over the Atlantic becomes maritime Polar (mP)

**What this means**: Originally dry continental air picks up moisture. By the time it reaches Switzerland from the west, it brings clouds and possible precipitation.

### 2. Continental Trajectory - Trajet continental
**Process**: Air mass moves over land

**Effect**: **Drying** - AssÃ¨chement
- Air loses moisture to the dry land surface
- Humidity decreases
- Clouds dissipate
- Skies clear

**What this means**: Maritime air crossing a continent loses moisture. This is why Atlantic air crossing France can arrive drier in Switzerland.

### 3. Warmer Surface - Trajet sur un sol plus chaud
**Process**: Air mass moves over a warmer surface

**Effects**:
- **Heating from below** - RÃ©chauffement
- **Destabilization** - Instabilisation
- Lower layers warm up faster than upper layers
- Creates instability â†’ convection
- Cumulus clouds form
- Potential for thermals and thunderstorms

**What this means**:
- **Winter**: Cold polar air over warmer sea â†’ shower activity
- **Summer**: Cool air heated by warm land â†’ thermal activity, Cu development
- **Good for gliding**: Heating creates thermals!

### 4. Colder Surface - Trajet sur un sol plus froid
**Process**: Air mass moves over a colder surface

**Effects**:
- **Cooling from below** - Refroidissement
- **Stabilization** - Stabilisation
- Lower layers cool down
- Inversion forms (warm air over cold air)
- Convection suppressed
- Fog and low stratus can form

**What this means**:
- **Autumn/Winter**: Warm air over cold land/water â†’ fog, low stratus
- **Poor for gliding**: Stable air, no thermals, low visibility
- **Example**: Warm Mediterranean air reaching cold Swiss plateau in autumn

## The Polar Front

Where **polar air** meets **tropical air**, a boundary forms called the **[polar front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_front)** - front polaire.

**Key characteristics**:
- **Location**: Around 40Â°-60Â° latitude (varies seasonally)
- **Significance**: Most weather systems affecting Europe form here
- **Nature**: Unstable boundary - constantly forming waves and depressions
- **Result**: Frontal systems (warm fronts, cold fronts, occlusions) that bring our day-to-day weather

**For Switzerland**: We are located near the polar front zone. Most of our weather changes come from frontal systems developing along this boundary.

## Air Mass Types Affecting Switzerland

| Source Region | Code | Common Season | Typical Weather |
|---------------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Arctic Maritime | mA | Winter | Very cold, snow showers |
| Polar Maritime | mP | All year | Cool, cloudy, showers (from west) |
| Polar Continental | cP | Winter | Cold, dry, clear |
| Tropical Maritime | mT | Summer | Warm, humid, potential thunderstorms (from SW) |
| Tropical Continental | cT | Summer | Hot, dry, stable initially (from SE/S) |

## Air Mass Frequencies for Switzerland

Based on wind direction statistics (from meteo3 slides):

- **West (O)**: 30% - Most common! Atlantic maritime polar air
- **Southwest (SO)**: 18% - Tropical maritime air (Mediterranean influence)
- **Northwest (NO)**: 22% - Arctic/polar maritime air
- **North (N)**: 1% - Rare
- **East (E)**: 3% - Rare, continental air
- **South (S)**: 5% - Mediterranean influence
- **Southeast (SE)**: 3% - Rare
- **Others**: Variable

**Key insight**: Switzerland receives air predominantly from the **west and northwest** (maritime, often polar origin) - about 52% of the time. This explains our generally humid, changeable weather with frequent frontal passages.

## Practical Applications for Glider Pilots

### Morning Weather Briefing

**Check the air mass**:
1. **Where did the air come from?** (Look at upper wind direction and recent weather maps)
2. **What surface did it cross?** (Maritime = humid; Continental = dry)
3. **Is it being heated or cooled?** (Summer day heating cold air = unstable = good!)

### Predicting Soaring Conditions

**Good soaring signs** (unstable air mass):
- Continental Polar air in summer (cP) â†’ heated from below â†’ excellent thermals
- Maritime air that has dried crossing land â†’ less cloud, good visibility
- Tropical Continental initially (cT) â†’ becomes unstable with heating

**Poor soaring signs** (stable air mass):
- Maritime Tropical in winter (mT) â†’ warm air over cold surface â†’ fog/stratus
- Freshly arrived maritime Polar without time to modify â†’ low clouds, drizzle
- Strong inversion (air mass cooled from below)

### Examples

**Scenario 1 - Perfect summer soaring day**:
- **Air mass**: Continental Polar (cP) from northeast
- **Modification**: Heated over warm summer land
- **Result**: Clear skies, strong thermals, high cloud base, excellent soaring!

**Scenario 2 - Poor autumn day**:
- **Air mass**: Maritime Tropical (mT) from southwest
- **Modification**: Cooled over cold autumn land
- **Result**: Fog, low stratus, stable air, no flying

**Scenario 3 - Spring shower day**:
- **Air mass**: Maritime Polar (mP) from west
- **Modification**: Heated over warming spring land
- **Result**: Cumulus, occasional showers, thermals between showers, flyable but tricky
