# Alpine Weather Situations (Situations typiques des Alpes)

## Overview
The Alps create unique weather patterns due to their massive mountain barrier effect. Understanding these typical Alpine situations is crucial for safe gliding operations in Switzerland and surrounding areas.

**ðŸ“– Reference**: [Lesson 3 Slides - Alpine Weather](slides/meteo3_part-051-100.pdf#page=1)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Alpine weather situations directly impact flight safety and soaring conditions:
- **Foehn winds** create strong turbulence and dangerous mountain waves
- **Clear visibility** on leeward sides can be deceptive - strong winds persist
- **Bise conditions** bring low stratus clouds over the Swiss Plateau
- Understanding pressure patterns helps predict these situations
- Knowing which side of the Alps has good/bad conditions is essential for flight planning

## 1. South Foehn (Foehn du sud)

### [Meteorological Setup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foehn_wind)

**Synoptic Pattern:**
- **Low pressure** over Western Europe (France/North Sea)
- **High pressure** over the Mediterranean or Eastern Europe
- This creates a **pressure gradient** forcing air from south to north across the Alps

**What this means**: The pressure difference acts like a pump, pushing Mediterranean air over the Alpine barrier. The greater the pressure difference, the stronger the Foehn.

### Physical Process

The Foehn effect involves several stages:

1. **Windward Side (South - Ticino):**
   - Moist Mediterranean air is forced upward
   - Air cools at saturated adiabatic rate (~0.6Â°C/100m)
   - Heavy cloud formation and precipitation
   - Water vapor condenses out, releasing latent heat

2. **Mountain Crest:**
   - Air has lost much of its moisture
   - Now relatively dry air crosses the peaks

3. **Leeward Side (North - Swiss Plateau):**
   - Air descends and warms at **dry adiabatic rate** (1Â°C/100m)
   - Since it warms faster than it cooled, air arrives warmer and drier
   - **FÃ¶hn wall** (mur de foehn): stationary cloud bank on south side of Alps
   - **FÃ¶hn gap** (fenÃªtre de foehn): clear area where air descends
   - **FÃ¶hn window** (trouÃ©e): cloud-free zone on north side

**Key Point**: The air warms more descending than it cooled ascending because:
- It cooled at the **saturated** rate going up (slower, ~0.6Â°C/100m)
- It warms at the **dry** rate coming down (faster, 1Â°C/100m)
- Net result: warmer, drier air on the leeward side

### Characteristics of South Foehn

**Weather Conditions:**
- **South side of Alps (Ticino)**: Cloudy, rainy, cooler
- **North side (Plateau/Jura)**:
  - Warm and very dry
  - Excellent visibility (50-100+ km)
  - Strong, gusty winds in valleys
  - Clear skies with possible lenticular clouds

**Wind Pattern:**
- Strong south winds in Alpine valleys (Uri, Glarus, etc.)
- Can reach 50-100+ km/h in valley systems
- Channeled through specific mountain passes

**Temperature Effect:**
- Dramatic warming on north side
- Temperature can rise 10-15Â°C within hours
- Snow melts rapidly in winter/spring
- Example visible on slide 62: Valais shows much warmer temperatures than surrounding areas

### Aviation Hazards

**Extreme Turbulence:**
- Severe [mountain wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_wave) activity
- **Rotors** (rotor) downwind of peaks - violent rotating air masses
- Can extend 50-100 km downwind
- Vertical currents of 5-10+ m/s possible

**Wind Strength:**
- Extremely strong winds in Alpine valleys
- Gusty conditions make landings dangerous
- Wind can exceed glider's maximum demonstrated crosswind component

**Deceptive Conditions:**
- Beautiful clear weather appears perfect for flying
- But conditions are extremely dangerous
- "FÃ¶hn situations mean no flying" is the rule for many clubs

### Recognition

**Visual Clues:**
- FÃ¶hn wall: dramatic cloud bank along south side of Alps
- Lenticular clouds: lens-shaped clouds in wave pattern
- Extremely clear visibility - can see very distant peaks
- Dust or haze blown from ground

**Weather Map Signs:**
- Low pressure west/northwest of Alps
- High pressure south/southeast of Alps
- Tight isobars perpendicular to Alpine chain

## 2. North Foehn (Foehn du nord)

### Meteorological Setup

**Synoptic Pattern:**
- **Low pressure** over Northern Italy/Mediterranean
- **High pressure** over Central/Northern Europe
- Pressure gradient forces air from **north to south**

**Less Common**: North Foehn occurs less frequently than South Foehn in Switzerland.

### Physical Process

Same Foehn mechanism, but reversed:

1. **Windward Side (North - Swiss Plateau):**
   - Cool, moist air from north forced up Alps
   - Clouds and precipitation on north side
   - Air loses moisture climbing

2. **Leeward Side (South - Ticino):**
   - Warm, dry air descends into Ticino
   - Clear skies and warm conditions in valleys south of Alps
   - Strong north winds in Alpine valleys

### Characteristics

**Weather Conditions:**
- **North side**: Cloudy, rainy, cooler (slides 58-60)
- **South side (Ticino)**: Warm, dry, excellent visibility
- Less intense than South Foehn typically

**Aviation Impact:**
- Strong turbulence and mountain waves
- Clear weather in Ticino but dangerous winds
- Difficult landing conditions at south-side airfields

## 3. Bise (High Pressure from Northeast)

### [Meteorological Setup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bise_(wind))

**Synoptic Pattern:**
- **High pressure** over Northern/Eastern Europe or Russia
- **Low pressure** over Western Mediterranean or France
- Creates **northeast wind** over Switzerland (slides 63-65)

**Regional Wind**: The Bise is a regional wind specific to Western Switzerland and the Swiss Plateau.

### Characteristics

**Weather Conditions on Swiss Plateau:**
- **Persistent northeast wind** - cold and often humid
- **Low stratus clouds** covering the Plateau (200-1500m altitude typically)
- Grey, dreary conditions can last days or even weeks
- Temperature **inversion** traps clouds below ~1500m

**Above the Stratus:**
- Sunny and pleasant above ~1500m altitude
- Sharp cloud top - dramatic transition
- Good soaring conditions in mountains

**Other Regions:**
- Jura: Often cloud-free or high-based clouds
- Alps: Generally good conditions
- Ticino: Usually sunny and nice

### Why the Low Stratus?

1. **Cold, moist air** flows from northeast
2. **Channeled by Jura mountains** onto Swiss Plateau
3. Air is **stable** (high pressure = subsidence inversion)
4. Moisture condenses at low altitude (radiation cooling at night reinforces)
5. **Inversion** prevents vertical mixing - clouds stay trapped

**Key Point**: The Bise isn't just wind - it's a weather situation that brings persistent low clouds to the Plateau while mountains remain clear.

### Gliding Implications

**If Based on Plateau:**
- Low cloud base (often <500m AGL)
- Poor visibility in stratus
- May be impossible to fly

**If Based in Mountains or Can Get Above:**
- Excellent conditions above the stratus "sea"
- Spectacular views
- Must ensure you can get back down (no outlanding in stratus!)

**Flight Planning:**
- Check cloud base forecasts
- Consider where you can land if stratus thickens
- Mountain airports above stratus may offer only option

## Comparison: Mistral

The [Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_(wind)) is shown on slide 63 for comparison:
- Strong **northwest wind** in RhÃ´ne Valley (France)
- Same high pressure pattern that causes Bise
- Brings clear, cold, windy conditions to Southern France
- Can affect western Swiss regions (Geneva, Valais)

## Summary Table

| Situation | Pressure Pattern | Wind Direction | North Side | South Side | Hazards |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|------------|------------|---------|
| **South Foehn** | Low NW, High SE | South | Warm, dry, clear, windy | Cloudy, wet, cooler | Extreme turbulence, rotors, strong winds |
| **North Foehn** | Low S, High N | North | Cloudy, wet, cooler | Warm, dry, clear, windy | Turbulence, mountain waves |
| **Bise** | High NE, Low W | Northeast | Low stratus on Plateau, clear mountains | Usually clear | Low visibility in stratus, limited landing options |

## Practical Advice

**Decision Making:**
- **Foehn situations**: Generally no-fly for gliders due to extreme turbulence
- **Bise**: Check cloud base - may be excellent above stratus or impossible below
- **Always check METAR/TAF** for cloud base and wind
- **Consult local pilots** - they know how conditions typically develop

**Pre-Flight:**
- Check pressure pattern on weather maps
- Look for tight isobars perpendicular to Alps (Foehn indicator)
- Check difference in temperature/wind between north and south of Alps
- Review webcams - can you see FÃ¶hn wall or stratus layer?
