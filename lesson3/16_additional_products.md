# 10.2-10.4 Additional Meteorological Products

## Overview

Beyond the main products (METAR, TAF, GAFOR, charts), several additional meteorological products provide valuable information for flight planning and operations.

**ðŸ“– Reference**: [Lesson 3 Part 3 - Additional Products](slides/meteo3_part-101-133.pdf#page=1) (Pages 101, 121-130)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

- **PIREP** - Real-time reports from other pilots (conditions actually encountered)
- **SIGMET/AIRMET** - Urgent warnings of significant weather hazards
- **Soundings** - Vertical atmospheric profiles (critical for wave/thermal forecasting)
- **MÃ©tÃ©ogrammes** - Time-series forecasts for specific locations
- **Gradient maps** - Special wind situations (fÃ¶hn, bise) prediction
- **Specialized tools** - AlpTherm, TopTherm for soaring-specific forecasts

## 10.2 PIREP - Pilot Reports (Informations de pilotes)

**ðŸ“– Reference**: Page 101

### What is PIREP?

**PIREP** = PIlot REPort (Rapport de pilote)

**Definition**: Weather observation report issued by a pilot describing atmospheric conditions encountered **during flight** or **after landing**.

### Purpose

- **Real-time ground truth** - Actual conditions, not forecast
- **Hazard alerts** - Turbulence, icing, CB locations pilots encounter
- **Verification** - Compare forecast to reality
- **Community support** - Help other pilots with current info

### How PIREP Works

**Process**:
1. **Pilot** encounters significant weather (good or bad)
2. **Transmits** report via radio to nearest **ATC** (Air Traffic Control)
3. **ATC** codes the message and sends it via communication networks
4. **Available** to other pilots, flight planners, and meteorological services

### PIREPs in Plain Language

Unlike METAR/TAF, PIREPs are transmitted in **clear language** (langage clair), not coded format.

**Example PIREP**:
"Geneva Control, HB-XYZ, position 20 km south of LSGG at FL095, encountering moderate turbulence, temperature minus 2, light icing."

**ATC would code this and disseminate** to other aircraft and Met services.

### What to Report

**Routine PIREPs**:
- Cloud bases and tops
- Visibility
- Temperature
- Wind (direction/speed at altitude)
- Icing (if any)

**Urgent PIREPs** (Special Air Report - AIREP):
- **Severe turbulence**
- **Moderate or severe icing**
- **Cumulonimbus** (CB) locations
- **Wind shear**
- **Volcanic ash**
- **Mountain wave** (severe)
- **Other hazards** affecting safety

### Direction Reference - CRITICAL

**All direction information given by air traffic control is referenced to MAGNETIC NORTH**, not true north.

**Example**: "Wind 270 magnetic at 30 knots" = From magnetic west (not true west)

### AIREP Example (from slides)

**ðŸ“– Reference**: Page 122

```
UAIY63 LIIB 241528
AIREP SPECIAL: A320 REPORTED MOD TURB AT FL360 OVER ORSOM AT 1526=
```

**Decode**:
- **UAIY63 LIIB**: Message routing header
- **241528**: 24th day, 15:28 UTC
- **AIREP SPECIAL**: Special pilot report (urgent)
- **A320**: Aircraft type (Airbus 320)
- **REPORTED**: Past tense - condition encountered
- **MOD TURB**: Moderate turbulence
- **AT FL360**: At flight level 360 (36,000 ft)
- **OVER ORSOM**: At waypoint ORSOM (navigation fix)
- **AT 1526**: At time 15:26 UTC

**Interpretation**: An Airbus A320 encountered moderate turbulence at 36,000 feet over waypoint ORSOM at 15:26 UTC.

**For gliders**: This particular report is at very high altitude (not relevant for gliding), but shows the format. Glider PIREPs would report lower altitudes and soaring-relevant conditions.

## SIGMET and AIRMET

**ðŸ“– Reference**: Page 121

### SIGMET - Significant Meteorological Information

## Soundings and Emagrammes

**ðŸ“– Reference**: Page 125

### What is a Sounding?

**Sounding** (Sondage/Radiosondage) = Vertical profile of atmosphere

**Measured by**:
- **Weather balloon** (ballon-sonde) carrying radiosonde instrument
- Launched twice daily (00 and 12 UTC) from ground stations
- Ascends to 30+ km altitude (to stratosphere)
- Measures: Temperature, pressure, humidity, wind at all altitudes

### Switzerland's Main Station

**Payerne** (46.8Â°N, 6.9Â°E, 491 m elevation)
- Switzerland's only regular upper-air station
- Launches at **00 UTC** and **12 UTC** daily (midnight and noon UTC)
- Data available ~1-2 hours after launch
- Critical for forecasting

### Emagram (Ã‰magramme)

**Emagram** = Graphical representation of atmospheric sounding

**Axes**:
- **X-axis**: Temperature (Â°C)
- **Y-axis**: Pressure (hPa) or Altitude (m)

**Lines Plotted**:
- **Temperature profile** (red line): Actual temperature at each altitude
- **Dewpoint profile** (blue line): Actual dewpoint at each altitude
- **Dry adiabats**: Lines showing cooling rate for unsaturated rising air (-1Â°C/100m)
- **Moist adiabats**: Lines showing cooling rate for saturated rising air (~-0.6Â°C/100m)

**What Emagram Shows**:
- **Stability**: Steep temperature profile = stable, shallow = unstable
- **Inversions**: Temperature increasing with altitude (layer of warm air over cold)
- **Cloud base**: Where temperature line meets dewpoint line
- **Humidity**: Gap between temperature and dewpoint (small gap = humid)
- **Freezing level**: Where temperature crosses 0Â°C
- **Thermal index** (TI): Potential thermal strength
- **Lifted condensation level** (LCL): Altitude where Cu base forms
- **Level of free convection** (LFC): Altitude where thermals become self-sustaining

**Uses for Gliding**:
- **Thermal forecasting**: Predict thermal strength and tops
- **Cloud base prediction**: Estimate cumulus base altitude
- **Wave potential**: Identify stable layers for wave flying
- **Inversion heights**: Know where thermals stop
- **Icing risk**: Check temperature profile for 0Â°C to -20Â°C zone in clouds

## MÃ©tÃ©ogramme

**ðŸ“– Reference**: Page 126

### What is a MÃ©tÃ©ogramme?

**MÃ©tÃ©ogramme** = Time-series graph showing forecast evolution at a specific location

**Time Axis**: Usually 3-7 days ahead (hourly or 3-hourly intervals)

**Parameters Shown** (stacked graphs):
- **Cloud cover** (top panel): Cloud layers at different altitudes, shaded by type
- **Wind barbs**: Direction and speed at 10m (or at altitude)
- **Temperature** and **dewpoint**: Curves showing evolution
- **Pressure**: QNH trend (rising/falling pressure)
- **Precipitation**: Amount and type (rain/snow/mixed)
- **Weather symbols**: Sun, clouds, rain, snow, thunderstorms

**Example Reading**:
```
Date: Wed 02 Feb â†’ Thu 03 Feb â†’ Fri 04 Feb

[Cloud panel]: Shows overcast Wed morning â†’ breaking Thu â†’ clear Fri

[Wind]: Light west Wed â†’ increasing southwest Thu â†’ strong west Fri

[Temp/Td]: 0Â°C Wed â†’ warming to 8Â°C Thu â†’ cooling to 4Â°C Fri
           Small spread Wed (humid) â†’ larger spread Fri (dry)

[Pressure]: 1000 hPa Wed â†’ 1010 hPa Fri (rising = improving)

[Precip]: Rain Wed morning â†’ no rain Thu-Fri
```

**Interpretation**: Frontal passage Wednesday (rain, low clouds), high pressure building Thursday-Friday (improving conditions).

**Uses for Gliding**:
- **Day-to-day planning**: When to fly (next 3-7 days)
- **Timing**: Best hours of the day for thermals
- **Weather window**: Between frontal systems
- **Temperature trends**: Warm = good thermals, cold = weak
- **Humidity**: Dewpoint spread indicates cu-nimb risk
