# Thunderstorms (Orages)

## Overview
[Thunderstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm) ([Cumulonimbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_cloud) clouds) are the most dangerous weather phenomenon for aviation. They combine extreme turbulence, icing, hail, lightning, wind shear, and reduced visibility in a single violent package.

**ðŸ“– Reference**: [Lesson 3 Slides - Thunderstorms](slides/meteo3_part-051-100.pdf#page=39)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

- **Extreme turbulence** can exceed aircraft structural limits
- **Severe icing** in seconds, even in summer
- **Hail** can damage or destroy aircraft
- **Lightning** strike risk
- **Microbursts** create un-survivable wind shear
- **Loss of control** - cannot maintain aircraft attitude
- **NO safe way to fly near Cb** - avoidance is the ONLY option

**Critical**: Every year, pilots die flying near thunderstorms. The dangers are real and well-documented.

## Cumulonimbus Life Cycle (Slide 90)

### Stage 1: Cumulus (Cu humilis â†’ mediocris)
- Small, building convective clouds
- Mostly updrafts
- No lightning yet
- Duration: 10-20 minutes

### Stage 2: Towering Cumulus (Congestus/TCu)
- Rapid vertical development
- Strong updrafts (5-10 m/s)
- Rain may begin
- Still building - not yet thunderstorm
- Duration: 20-40 minutes
- **Critical**: Can develop into Cb in minutes!

### Stage 3: Cumulonimbus (Cb) - Mature Stage
- Reaches tropopause (anvil top forms)
- **Strongest updrafts AND downdrafts** (10-30+ m/s)
- Heavy precipitation
- **Lightning and thunder**
- Hail
- Gust front spreading at surface
- Duration: 30-60 minutes
- **MOST DANGEROUS STAGE**

### Stage 4: Dissipating
- Updrafts weakening
- Mostly downdrafts and precipitation
- Anvil spreads downwind
- Still hazardous (gust fronts, wind shear)
- Duration: 30+ minutes

**What this means**: A small cumulus cloud at 10:00 can be a towering Cu by 11:00 and a full Cb by 12:00. Development can be very rapid!

## Thunderstorm Hazards (Slide 91)

**Inside and Near the Cloud:**

### 1. Extreme Vertical Currents
- **Updrafts**: 10-30 m/s (up to 50 m/s in severe storms!)
- **Downdrafts**: Equally strong
- Rapid, uncontrollable altitude changes
- Can tear aircraft apart

### 2. Severe Turbulence
- Extreme turbulence in/near cloud
- Exceeds aircraft structural limits
- Impossible to control aircraft
- Occupants injured by G-forces

### 3. Icing (Givrage)
- Heavy icing even in summer
- Large supercooled droplets
- Rapid accumulation
- Clear ice (most dangerous type)
- Can accumulate inches of ice in minutes

### 4. Lightning (Ã‰clairs)
- Direct strike can damage aircraft, electronics
- Even indirect nearby strikes are hazardous

### 5. Hail (Averses)
- Can be baseball-sized or larger
- Thrown out from updrafts
- Can travel kilometers from cloud
- Destroys aircraft on contact
- Can be ejected from anvil into clear air

### 6. Wind Shear / Microbursts
- Gust front ahead of storm
- Microbursts beneath storm
- Extreme horizontal and vertical wind shear
- Covered in [Wind Shear](09_wind_shear.md) topic

### 7. Reduced Visibility
- Heavy rain
- Low clouds and precipitation
- Possible IMC conditions

## Types of Thunderstorms (Slide 92)

### Thermal/Heat Thunderstorms (Orages thermiques)
**Formation:**
- Hot summer days
- Weak pressure gradients (marais baromÃ©trique - barometric swamp)
- Local instability from surface heating

**Characteristics:**
- Generally **stationary**
- **Short-lived** (30-60 minutes individual cells)
- Form in afternoon (peak 2-5 PM)
- Often multiple cells over region

**Impacts:**
- **Heavy local rainfall**
- Localized hazards
- Can re-develop in same location daily

**Forecasting**:
- Common in summer with weak gradients
- Question 6 from QA: Thunderstorm risk highest with "marais baromÃ©trique" + warming of low-level air + high humidity

### Orographic Thunderstorms (Orages orographiques)
**Formation:**
- Moist air forced up mountain slopes
- Topography determines location
- Combined with thermal effects

**Characteristics:**
- **Location determined by terrain**
- Form on windward slopes
- Afternoon development typical
- Can be forecast by location

**Impacts:**
- **Heavy precipitation** in mountain areas
- Flash flooding in valleys
- Localized to specific peaks/valleys

### Frontal Thunderstorms (Front orageux)
**Formation:**
- Associated with cold fronts (most common)
- Occasionally with warm fronts
- Frontal lifting + instability = Cb

**Characteristics:**
- **Dynamic - move with front**
- Organized in lines (squall lines)
- Can be severe
- Longer-lasting systems

**Impacts:**
- **Strong winds and gusts**
- **Hail** common
- Can affect large areas
- Move predictably with front

**Questions 4-5 from QA**: Unstable cold front brings convective clouds (Cb) with associated hazards

## Recognizing Thunderstorm Development

**Visual Clues:**

**Early Signs:**
- Morning: Good visibility, some Cu
- Late morning: Cu growing larger
- Noon: Towering Cu (TCu) appearing
- Early afternoon: Anvil tops forming

**Mature Cb Indicators:**
- Anvil top (flat, spreading)
- Dark base
- Heavy precipitation shafts
- Mammatus clouds on underside
- Roll clouds or shelf clouds at leading edge

**Slides 89, 93-95** show dramatic Cb examples:
- Slide 89: Developing Cb with characteristic anvil shape
- Slide 93: Rain shaft visible beneath storm
- Slide 94: Cb with clear precipitation core
- Slide 95: Shelf cloud/arc cloud at leading edge - indicates strong gust front

**Radar:**
- Red/purple colors = heavy precipitation
- Lines of echoes = squall line
- Isolated cells vs. widespread activity

## Distance Estimation

**Lightning to Thunder:**
- Light travels instantly
- Sound travels ~340 m/s (roughly 1 km per 3 seconds)
- Count seconds between flash and thunder
- Divide by 3 = distance in kilometers
- If < 10 seconds = storm within 3 km = DANGER

**Visual:**
- If you can see lightning, you're too close
- If you can hear thunder, you're WAY too close
- Don't wait to hear/see - avoid by wide margin

## Avoidance Rules

**Minimum Separation:**
- **20 km** (10 NM) horizontal from any Cb or TCu
- More for severe storms or squall lines
- **Do NOT fly under anvil** - hail can fall from it
- **Do NOT attempt to fly between cells** - they can merge

**Decision Making:**

**Before Flight:**
- Check thunderstorm forecast
- Afternoon Cb expected? Plan to land by noon
- Frontal system with Cb? Stay on ground
- Satellite/radar: Are Cb in area?

**During Flight:**
- Continuous monitoring of Cumulus development
- Are clouds building (getting taller)?
- Are bases darkening?
- **Land before Cb develops** - not after!

**If Cb Develop:**
1. **Land immediately** if any Cb in area
2. Don't try to "get home" or "finish flight"
3. Any suitable field is better than continuing
4. Give wide berth - minimum 20 km

**The Critical Window:**
- Thermal Cb typically develop 12:00-16:00
- If conditions favor development, plan to land by 12:00-13:00
- Don't wait to see if they actually form!

## Emergency: Too Close to Cb

**If Caught Near Thunderstorm:**
1. **Turn away immediately** - don't try to penetrate
2. **Avoid the base and anvil** - most dangerous areas
3. **Increase speed** - better structural margin
4. **Tighten seat belts**
5. **Land ASAP** even in marginal field
6. **Fly upwind of storm if possible** (gust fronts move with storm)

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't try to fly through "small" areas
- Don't fly between cells
- Don't fly under anvil
- Don't continue hoping it will dissipate

## Summary Table (from Slide 92)

| Type | Characteristics | Impacts |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Thermal** | Stationary, short-lived, afternoon | Heavy local rain |
| **Orographic** | Location determined by terrain, predictable | Heavy rain in mountains |
| **Frontal** | Dynamic, moving, organized lines | Strong gusts, hail, widespread |

## Summary

**Key Principles:**
- Cb are the single most dangerous weather phenomenon for aviation
- Development can be rapid - small Cu to Cb in 1-2 hours
- NEVER intentionally fly near Cb - minimum 20 km separation
- Land BEFORE Cb develop, not after
- All Cb are dangerous - there's no "small" thunderstorm
- Gust fronts extend well beyond visible cloud
- Hail can fall from anvil into "clear" air

**The Rule**: If thunderstorms are forecast or developing, stay on the ground or land immediately. NO flight is worth dying for.

## Questions & Answers

### Q5: Lequel des phÃ©nomÃ¨nes ci-dessous est typique en Ã©tÃ©, lors du passage d'un front froid instable?
**English**: Which of the following phenomena is typical in summer during the passage of an unstable cold front?

**A) Nuages stratiformes** - Stratiform clouds
**B) Accroissement rapide de la tempÃ©rature Ã  l'arriÃ¨re du front** - Rapid temperature increase behind front
**C) Abaissement rapide de la pression atmosphÃ©rique Ã  l'arriÃ¨re du front** - Rapid pressure drop behind front
**D) Nuages convectifs** âœ“ - Convective clouds

**Answer (EN)**: D) Convective clouds (Cumulonimbus)

**Explanation**: An unstable cold front, especially in summer, is characterized by convective activity. The cold, dense air undercuts the warm air ahead, forcing it upward rapidly. Combined with summer instability (warm surface, cold aloft), this creates strong convection leading to Cb formation. Stratiform clouds are associated with stable conditions. Temperature and pressure patterns are different from described in B and C.

### Q6: Dans quelle situation la tendance aux orages sera la plus marquÃ©e?
**English**: In which situation will the thunderstorm tendency be most pronounced?

**Options** (simplified):
- A) Barometric swamp + cooling of lower layers + high humidity
- B) High pressure + warming of lower layers + low humidity
- **C) Barometric swamp + warming of lower layers + high humidity** âœ“
- D) Barometric swamp + warming of upper layers + high humidity

**Answer (EN)**: C) Barometric swamp (weak pressure gradients) + warming of low-level air + high humidity

**Explanation**: Thunderstorms require:
1. **Instability**: Warming LOW-level air (not upper) creates instability - warm air wants to rise
2. **Moisture**: High humidity provides "fuel" - water vapor for latent heat release
3. **Trigger**: Weak gradients (marais baromÃ©trique) allow local effects to dominate

Option C combines all three factors. Warming UPPER layers (D) would stabilize atmosphere. High pressure (B) causes subsidence (stable). Cooling low layers (A) also creates stability.
