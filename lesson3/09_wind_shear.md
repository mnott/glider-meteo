# Wind Shear and Turbulence (Cisaillement de vent)

## Overview
[Wind shear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear) is a change in wind speed and/or direction over a short distance. For glider pilots, wind shear creates turbulence and can cause sudden airspeed changes that are especially dangerous near the ground.

**ðŸ“– Reference**: [Lesson 3 Slides - Wind Shear](slides/meteo3_part-051-100.pdf#page=36)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

- **Low-speed flight** makes gliders vulnerable to airspeed changes
- **No engine** to recover from loss of airspeed
- **Near-ground wind shear** can cause stall during landing approach
- **Turbulence** can overstress aircraft or cause loss of control
- **Rotors and downbursts** can force aircraft into terrain

**Critical**: Wind shear is invisible but deadly, especially during takeoff and landing.

## Types of Wind Shear

### 1. Vertical Wind Shear

**Definition**: Wind speed/direction changes with altitude (Slide 86 - left diagram)

**Causes:**
- Surface friction slows wind near ground
- Different air masses at different altitudes
- Jet streams
- Frontal boundaries
- Mountain wave wind reversal with height

**Effects:**
- **Gradient** creates turbulence (mixing between layers)
- Stronger shear = more turbulence
- Common cause of approach turbulence

**What this means**: As you descend on approach, you transition through layers of different wind speeds. If the gradient is strong, you'll experience turbulence and sudden airspeed changes.

### 2. Horizontal Wind Shear

**Definition**: Wind changes across horizontal distance

**Causes:**
- Frontal boundaries (warm/cold fronts)
- Outflow boundaries from thunderstorms (gust fronts)
- Sea breeze fronts
- Terrain channeling effects

**Effects:**
- Sudden airspeed changes
- Turbulent transition zone
- Can cause rapid altitude changes

### 3. Low-Level Wind Shear

**Most Dangerous Type** - occurs near ground during takeoff/landing

**Causes:**
- Surface friction (wind increases with altitude from surface)
- Temperature inversions
- Thunderstorm gust fronts
- Frontal passages
- Terrain effects

**Hazard**: Encountering headwind shear during approach increases your airspeed - good. But then losing that headwind near ground decreases airspeed suddenly - can cause stall. (Slide 86-88)

## Sources of Wind Shear and Turbulence

### 1. Atmospheric Flow (Ã‰coulement)

**Large-Scale Shear** (Slide 87 - left):
- High-altitude wind different from low-altitude wind
- Creates layers of turbulence
- Common with strong jet stream
- Frontal zones

### 2. Convection (Slide 87 - center)

**Thunderstorms:**
- Violent updrafts inside (10+ m/s)
- Downdrafts equally strong
- **Gust fronts** - outflow spreading at surface
- Extreme horizontal and vertical shear
- Can extend 10-20 km from visible cloud

**What this means**: You don't have to be in the thunderstorm to encounter dangerous shear - the outflow can affect you well away from the visible precipitation.

**Characteristics:**
- Roll clouds or shelf clouds mark gust front
- Dramatic wind shift (speed and direction)
- Temperature drop
- Dust/debris being blown

### 3. Friction and Surface Effects (Frottements) (Slide 87 - right)

**Boundary Layer Turbulence:**
- Surface roughness (trees, buildings) creates turbulence
- Wind increases with height
- Strongest shear in lowest 100m
- Wors during daytime with solar heating

**Thermal Activity:**
- Thermals create localized strong updrafts
- Sink between thermals
- Turbulent transitions
- Affects approach/landing

### 4. Mountain/Terrain Effects

**Mechanical Turbulence:**
- Flow over obstacles creates eddies
- Rotors downwind of ridges
- Channeling through valleys
- Enhanced by stable atmosphere

## Microburst and Downburst (Slide 88)

**Definition**: Strong downward airflow from thunderstorm spreads out at surface

**Characteristics:**
- Extreme wind shear in all directions
- Can exceed 50 kt wind change over short distance
- Headwind becomes tailwind within seconds
- Lasts 5-15 minutes
- Diameter 1-5 km

**Visual Clues:**
- Rain shaft with dust/debris at surface
- Virga (rain not reaching ground)
- Ring of dust spreading outward
- Shelf cloud

**Hazard**: Aircraft flying through experiences:
1. Strong headwind (airspeed increases)
2. Downdraft (altitude loss)
3. Sudden switch to tailwind (airspeed collapses)
4. Near ground = no altitude to recover

**Avoidance**: Do NOT fly near thunderstorms or under virga. Period.

## Wind Gradient on Approach (Slide 86)

**Normal Gradient:**
- Wind speed increases with altitude
- Expect ~20% increase at pattern altitude vs. surface

**On Final Approach Descent:**
- Flying from stronger wind (aloft) to weaker wind (surface)
- Lose headwind component
- Airspeed decreases
- Can lose 5-10 kt or more

**Pilot Response:**
- Anticipate airspeed loss
- Carry extra speed in shear conditions
- Don't let airspeed decay below target
- Be ready to pitch down if needed

**Strong Shear Conditions:**
- Frontal passage
- Thunderstorm nearby
- Strong wind day (>15 kt)
- Consider adding 50% of wind gust value to approach speed

## Recognition and Avoidance

**Pre-Flight:**
- Check surface wind vs. winds aloft forecast
- Large difference = shear likely
- METAR: Large wind gusts indicate turbulence
- SIGMET for turbulence or convection

**In Flight - Visual Clues:**
- Ragged, torn clouds = turbulence
- Dust devils or dust being blown
- Roll clouds, shelf clouds = gust front
- Virga = potential microburst
- Lenticular clouds = mountain wave

**In Flight - Performance Clues:**
- Airspeed fluctuations
- Difficult to maintain altitude
- Control inputs needed frequently

**Avoidance:**
- Stay away from thunderstorms (20+ km)
- Don't fly under virga
- Avoid lee side of mountains in strong wind
- Land before thunderstorms arrive
- Consider delaying flight if severe shear forecast

## Decision Making

**When Wind Shear is Forecast:**
- Assess severity - is it within your skill level?
- Consider aircraft limitations
- Have alternate plan
- Brief shear procedures before takeoff/landing

**If Encountering Severe Shear:**
- Maintain/increase airspeed
- Accept altitude loss if needed to maintain speed
- Don't try to climb through microburst - get out sideways
- Land ASAP if shear is affecting your control

**Near Thunderstorms:**
- Give at least 20 km clearance
- More if large Cb or severe storm
- Gust fronts can race ahead of visible storm
- If caught by gust front, land immediately (wind direction will shift)

## Summary

**Key Principles:**
- Wind shear is invisible - must anticipate based on conditions
- Most dangerous near ground (takeoff/landing)
- Thunderstorms create extreme shear - avoid by wide margin
- Vertical wind profile creates turbulence
- Carry extra speed in shear conditions
- When in doubt, don't fly or land early

**The Rule**: If thunderstorms are in the area, stay on the ground. Microburst shear has killed many pilots.
