# Fronts

## Overview
A [front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_front) (front) is the boundary or transition zone between two different air masses with distinct temperature, humidity, and density characteristics. Fronts are the primary cause of significant weather changes in mid-latitudes.

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Understanding fronts is critical because:
- **Major weather changes**: Fronts bring rapid shifts in wind, temperature, clouds, and precipitation
- **Flight planning**: Frontal passage can make the difference between excellent soaring and unflyable conditions
- **Safety**: Some fronts (especially cold fronts) bring dangerous weather including thunderstorms, wind shear, and turbulence
- **Timing**: Knowing frontal movement helps you decide when to launch and when to land
- **Post-frontal opportunities**: The "tra√Æne" (trailing sector) after a cold front can offer spectacular soaring

## Types of Fronts

### 1. Warm Front - Front chaud

**Definition**: A warm front occurs when warm air advances and replaces colder air.

**Structure**:
- **Slope**: Very gentle (~1:100 to 1:300) - pente faible
- **Width**: 100-1000 km (very wide) - large
- **Movement**: Slow (15-30 km/h typically) - lent
- **Warm air**: Glides up over the cold air wedge

**Cloud Sequence** (from ahead of front):
1. **Cirrus (Ci)** - First sign, 500-1000 km ahead - cirrus
2. **Cirrostratus (Cs)** - Halo around sun/moon - cirrostratus
3. **Altostratus (As)** - Sun becomes dim, disappears - altostratus
4. **Altocumulus (Ac)** - Often present - altocumulus
5. **Nimbostratus (Ns)** - Main precipitation cloud - nimbostratus
6. **Stratus (St)** - Low clouds - stratus
7. **Stratocumulus (Sc)** - After frontal passage - stratocumulus

**Weather Characteristics**:
- **Before front**: Sky gradually clouds over (12-24 hours), pressure falls steadily, wind backs (shifts counterclockwise)
- **At front**: Continuous light to moderate precipitation (rain/snow), poor visibility, low cloud base
- **After front**: Precipitation ends, clouds may persist, temperature rises, pressure steadies, wind veers (shifts clockwise)
- **0¬∞C isotherm**: Typically shallow angle, rises gently with the front

**Stable vs. Unstable Warm Front**:

**Stable** (typical):
- Stratiform clouds only
- Continuous light precipitation
- Relatively calm

**Unstable** (if warm air is unstable):
- Cumulonimbus (Cb) embedded in Nimbostratus
- Heavy showers, possible thunderstorms
- More dangerous!

**For Gliding**:
- **Approach**: Deteriorating conditions, not flyable once clouds lower
- **At passage**: No flying - low clouds, precipitation, poor visibility
- **After passage**: Often still cloudy and stable - wait for cold front or better conditions

### 2. Cold Front - Front froid

**Definition**: A cold front occurs when cold air advances and displaces warmer air.

**Structure**:
- **Slope**: Steep (~1:50 to 1:100) - pente forte
- **Width**: ~100 km (narrow) - √©troit
- **Movement**: Fast (30-60 km/h typically) - rapide
- **Cold air**: Pushes under the warm air like a wedge, forcing it upward rapidly

**Cloud Sequence**:
1. **Ahead of front** (in warm sector):
   - Cumulus (Cu) if warm air unstable
   - Stratocumulus (Sc) if stable
   - Sometimes Cirrus/Cirrostratus ahead
2. **At the front**:
   - Altocumulus (Ac)
   - Altostratus (As)
   - Nimbostratus (Ns)
   - **Cumulonimbus (Cb)** if unstable!
3. **Behind front** (tra√Æne):
   - Cumulus (Cu)
   - Cumulonimbus (Cb) possible
   - Eventually clearing

**Weather Characteristics**:
- **Before front**: Warm, often humid, possible Cu development, pressure falls, wind from SW typically
- **At front**: Sudden wind shift (can change 90¬∞ in minutes!), wind strengthens, temperature drops rapidly, heavy precipitation (often showery), possible thunderstorms
- **After front** ("tra√Æne"): Temperature drop, pressure rises, wind from NW typically, showery weather, cumulus clouds, eventual clearing

**Stable vs. Unstable Cold Front**:

**Stable**:
- Stratiform clouds dominate
- Light to moderate continuous precipitation
- Less dramatic passage

**Unstable** (common in summer):
- Cumulonimbus along and ahead of front
- Heavy showers, thunderstorms
- Severe turbulence
- Hail possible
- **Very dangerous for aviation!**

**For Gliding**:
- **Before passage**: Can be good flying in warm sector (thermals), but watch for Cb development
- **At passage**: **STAY ON THE GROUND** - thunderstorms, wind shear, turbulence, squalls
- **After passage (tra√Æne)**: Often excellent soaring! - Cold unstable air, cumulus, good visibility, strong thermals
- **Timing is everything**: Land before front arrives, wait for main activity to pass (~1-2 hours), then enjoy the tra√Æne

### 3. Occluded Front - Front occlus

**Definition**: An occlusion occurs when a cold front catches up with a warm front, lifting the warm sector completely off the ground.

**Formation**:
- Cold fronts move faster than warm fronts
- Eventually the cold front catches the warm front
- The warm sector is lifted ("occluded") - occlus
- Two types depending on which air is coldest

**Types**:

#### Warm Occlusion - Occlusion √† caract√®re de front chaud
- Air behind cold front is **warmer** than air ahead of warm front
- Cold front air rides up over the colder air ahead
- Weather similar to warm front
- More common early in occlusion process

#### Cold Occlusion - Occlusion √† caract√®re de front froid
- Air behind cold front is **colder** than air ahead of warm front
- Cold front air undercuts everything
- Weather similar to cold front
- More common in mature systems
- Can produce Cumulonimbus

**Cloud Structure**:
- Complex multi-layer system
- Nimbostratus (Ns) common
- Cirrus (Ci), Cirrostratus (Cs) ahead
- Possible Cumulonimbus (Cb) embedded
- Stratus (St) at surface

**Weather Characteristics**:
- Wide area of clouds and precipitation
- Can produce heavy rain/snow
- Prolonged poor conditions
- Eventually weakens as system matures

**For Gliding**:
- Generally **not flyable**
- Low clouds, precipitation, poor visibility
- Wait for the system to pass
- May take 12-24 hours

### 4. Stationary Front - Front stationnaire

**Definition**: A front that is not moving, or moving very slowly (<5 km/h).

**Cause**:
- Opposing air masses balanced in strength
- Terrain blocking (e.g., mountains)
- Weakening frontal system

**Weather Characteristics**:
- Persistent clouds along front
- Prolonged precipitation possible
- Weather changes little from day to day
- Can persist for several days

**Symbol**: Alternating warm and cold front symbols (triangles and semicircles on opposite sides)

**For Gliding**:
- Depends on which side of front you're on
- Typically stable conditions
- May offer ridge soaring if aligned with wind
- Generally not great thermal soaring

## Front Representation on Weather Maps

Understanding weather map symbols is essential for flight planning:

| Front Type | Symbol | Movement |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Warm Front | Red line with semicircles | Semicircles point direction of movement |
| Cold Front | Blue line with triangles | Triangles point direction of movement |
| Occluded Front | Purple line with alternating triangles and semicircles | Combined symbol |
| Stationary Front | Alternating colors, opposing symbols | Little to no movement |

**Reading a weather map**:
1. **Isobars** (lines of equal pressure) - lignes isobares: Closer spacing = stronger winds
2. **H** = High pressure (anticyclone) - haute pression
3. **L** = Low pressure (depression) - basse pression / d√©pression
4. **Wind direction**: Parallel to isobars (Northern Hemisphere: low pressure to your left when wind at your back)

## The Warm Sector - Secteur chaud

**Definition**: The area of warm air between the warm front and the cold front in a depression.

**Characteristics**:
- Warmest air in the system
- Can be stable or unstable depending on air mass
- SW winds typically (in Northern Hemisphere)
- Duration: Hours to 1-2 days before cold front arrives

**For Gliding**:
- **If unstable**: Good thermal soaring, possible Cu development
- **If stable**: Poor soaring, hazy, humid
- **Watch for**: Approaching cold front - monitor weather, plan to land early

## The Trailing Sector - Tra√Æne

**Definition**: The area behind a cold front where cold air has replaced warm air.

**Characteristics** (after cold front passage):
- Colder temperature
- NW winds (typically in Europe)
- Cumulus clouds
- Showery precipitation
- Good visibility
- Unstable air

**For Gliding**:
- **Often excellent soaring conditions!**
- Strong thermals (cold air heated from below)
- Cumulus marking thermals
- Good visibility
- Watch for: Cumulonimbus (thunderstorms) - avoid by 20+ km
- Best conditions: 2-6 hours after cold front passage

**Famous saying**: *"Red sky at night, sailor's delight; Red sky in morning, sailor's warning"*
- Red sky at night = Clear air to west (high pressure/tra√Æne coming) = Good weather tomorrow
- Red sky in morning = Clear air to east (good weather leaving) = Bad weather (front) approaching

## Frontal Weather Hazards for Aviation

### Cold Front Hazards (Most Dangerous)

1. **Cumulonimbus** - orage
   - Severe turbulence
   - Hail
   - Lightning
   - Violent updrafts/downdrafts (10+ m/s)
   - **Stay 20+ km away**

2. **Wind Shear** - cisaillement du vent
   - Sudden wind direction change (up to 90¬∞)
   - Rapid speed changes
   - Can be near ground (very dangerous for landing)

3. **Squall Line** - ligne de grains
   - Line of thunderstorms along or ahead of front
   - Can extend 100+ km
   - Extremely dangerous

4. **Poor Visibility** - mauvaise visibilit√©
   - Heavy precipitation
   - Restricts vision

### Warm Front Hazards

1. **Low Cloud Base** - plafond bas
   - Stratus often below 500 m AGL
   - Can trap gliders

2. **Freezing Rain** - pluie vergla√ßante (winter)
   - Precipitation falls through cold layer
   - Immediate severe icing
   - Extremely dangerous

3. **Fog** - brouillard
   - Forms in warm air ahead of front
   - Can develop rapidly

4. **Embedded Cb** - Cb noy√©s
   - Thunderstorms hidden in stratus layers
   - Can't see them coming

### Safety Rules

**Before Flight**:
1. Check synoptic weather map
2. Identify any fronts within 300 km
3. Estimate frontal arrival time
4. Plan to land well before front arrives

**During Flight**:
1. Monitor clouds for Cb development
2. Watch wind direction/speed changes
3. Notice pressure tendency (falling = front approaching)
4. Land immediately if frontal weather arrives early

**Cold Front**:
- Land **at least 1-2 hours before** estimated arrival
- If Cb visible, land immediately
- Never try to "outrun" a cold front

**Warm Front**:
- Land when cloud base drops below comfortable margin
- Don't get caught above stratus layer

## Questions & Answers

### Q1: Quel type de front sur l'image satellite visible pr√©c√©dente?
**English**: What type of front is shown on the visible satellite image?

**R√©ponse (FR)**: Front froid

**Answer (EN)**: Cold front

**Explanation**: On satellite images, cold fronts appear as narrow, sharp-edged bands of clouds with a characteristic curved shape. The steep slope of cold fronts creates a well-defined cloud edge where the warm air is forced upward rapidly.

### Q2: Quelles sont ses caract√©ristiques?
**English**: What are its characteristics?

**R√©ponse (FR)**: Pente forte, plut√¥t √©troit, progresse g√©n√©ralement plus rapidement qu'un front chaud

**Answer (EN)**: Steep slope, rather narrow, generally progresses faster than a warm front

**Explanation**: Cold fronts have three key distinguishing characteristics:
- **Steep slope** (1:50 to 1:100): Cold air pushes under warm air like a wedge
- **Narrow width** (~100 km): Concentrated weather along a thin band
- **Fast movement** (30-60 km/h): Cold air advances aggressively, catching up to warm fronts

### Q3: Pouvez-vous donner le nom de la zone √† l'arri√®re du front?
**English**: Can you give the name of the zone behind the front?

**R√©ponse (FR)**: Tra√Æne dans laquelle se forment des cumulus (voire des orages), zone souvent favorable pour le vol √† voile

**Answer (EN)**: Trailing sector (tra√Æne) in which cumulus form (even thunderstorms), zone often favorable for gliding

**Explanation**: The **tra√Æne** is the area behind a cold front characterized by:
- Cold air that gets heated from below (especially in summer)
- Formation of cumulus clouds
- Possible development of showers or thunderstorms
- Good visibility
- **Often excellent for thermal soaring** - cold unstable air produces strong thermals marked by cumulus

### Q5: Lequel des ph√©nom√®nes ci-dessous est typique en √©t√©, lors du passage d'un front froid instable? D) Nuages convectifs
**English**: Which of the following phenomena is typical in summer during the passage of an unstable cold front? D) Convective clouds

**R√©ponse (FR)**: D) Nuages convectifs

**Answer (EN)**: D) Convective clouds

**Explanation**: An **unstable cold front** in summer is characterized by:
- **Convective clouds**: Cumulus and Cumulonimbus along the front
- Rapid upward motion of warm air
- **NOT stratiform clouds** (those indicate stable conditions)
- Temperature **drops** behind front (not increases)
- Pressure **rises** behind front (not falls)

The key word is **instable** (unstable) ‚Üí convection ‚Üí cumuliform clouds (Cu, Cb) ‚Üí thunderstorms
