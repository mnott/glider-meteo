# General Weather Patterns (Climatology)

## Overview
Switzerland's weather is dominated by several recurring large-scale atmospheric patterns. Understanding these **situations générales** (general weather patterns) helps pilots predict conditions days in advance and understand seasonal weather tendencies.

**📖 Reference**: [Lesson 3 Slides - General Situations](slides/meteo3_part-001-050.pdf#page=32)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Understanding general patterns is essential because:
- **Recognition**: Learn to identify patterns from weather maps
- **Prediction**: Each pattern brings characteristic weather
- **Planning**: Multi-day trip planning based on pattern changes
- **Statistics**: Know which patterns are most frequent
- **Seasonal**: Different patterns dominate in different seasons

## Air Mass Flow Frequency for Switzerland

Based on climatological data (from slides):

| Direction | Frequency | Typical Air Mass | Common Season |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **West (O)** | **30%** | Maritime Polar | All year |
| **Northwest (NO)** | **22%** | Arctic/Polar Maritime | Winter/Spring |
| **Southwest (SO)** | **18%** | Tropical Maritime | Summer |
| **East (E)** | 3% | Continental | Rare |
| **South (S)** | 5% | Mediterranean | Spring/Autumn |
| **Southeast (SE)** | 3% | Continental | Rare |
| **North (N)** | 1% | Very rare | - |
| **Anticyclonic/Calm** | ~18% | Variable | All year |

**Key insight**: **72% of our weather** comes from the **western quadrant** (NW + W + SW). This explains Switzerland's generally humid, changeable weather.

## Major Weather Patterns

### 1. Westerly Flow - Courant d'ouest

**Most common pattern** (~30% of days)

**Synoptic setup**:
- Low pressure north (over Iceland/Scandinavia)
- High pressure south (over Azores/Mediterranean)
- **Result**: Strong west-to-east pressure gradient
- Jet stream flows west-to-east across Europe

**Air mass**: Maritime Polar (mP) from Atlantic

**Characteristics**:
- **Wind**: W to SW, moderate to strong (15-35 km/h surface)
- **Weather**: Changeable - frontal systems pass every 2-5 days
- **Clouds**: Variable - clear in ridges, cloudy/rainy with fronts
- **Temperature**: Mild (maritime influence moderates extremes)
- **Visibility**: Moderate (humid air)

**Weather sequence** (typical):
1. Day 1-2: Warm sector or ridge → partly cloudy, mild
2. Day 3: Warm front → clouds thicken, rain begins
3. Day 4: Cold front → heavy showers, wind shift, cooler
4. Day 5-6: Traîne → showers, cumulus, clearing
5. Day 7: Ridge begins → repeat cycle

**For gliding**:
- **Ridge/warm sector days**: Good thermal soaring
- **Traîne days**: Excellent wave soaring in lee of Alps (föhn possible) or thermal soaring with Cu
- **Frontal days**: No flying
- **Key skill**: Timing flights between frontal passages

**Seasons**:
- **All year**: Most common pattern
- **Spring/Autumn**: Most active (strong temperature contrasts)
- **Summer**: Weaker, slower-moving systems
- **Winter**: Strongest systems, frequent storms

**Example map**: Low over North Sea, high over Spain, tight isobars running W-E across Switzerland

### 2. Anticyclonic Pattern - Situation anticyclonique

**Second most common** (~18-20% of days, but varies by season)

**Synoptic setup**:
- High pressure over or near Switzerland
- Weak pressure gradients
- Subsiding air (descending motion)

**Air mass**: Variable - depends on high's origin and history

**Characteristics**:
- **Wind**: Light and variable, often local winds dominate (valley/mountain winds)
- **Clouds**: Few to none at altitude, possible morning fog/stratus at low levels
- **Temperature**: Extremes (hot in summer, cold in winter)
- **Visibility**: Excellent above inversion, poor below (haze, fog)
- **Stability**: Usually stable due to subsidence inversion

**Two flavors**:

#### Summer Anticyclone - Été
- **Sky**: Blue or scattered fair-weather Cu by afternoon
- **Temperature**: Hot (can exceed 30°C on plateau, hotter in valleys)
- **Thermals**: Strong in afternoon (after morning inversion breaks)
- **Cloud base**: High (2500-3500m AGL typical)
- **For gliding**: **Excellent!** Strong thermals, high cloud bases, blue or marked by Cu

**Perfect summer high characteristics**:
- Centered over Central Europe
- 1020-1030 hPa
- Weak flow
- Few days old (subsidence established)

#### Winter Anticyclone - Hiver/automne
- **Inversion**: Strong and persistent (often 800-1000m)
- **Below inversion**: Cold, fog, stratus ("grisaille"), poor visibility
- **Above inversion**: **Sunny, warm** (temperature inversion = warmer air above!)
- **Mountains**: Excellent conditions above fog layer
- **Plateau**: Trapped in cold, grey soup for days

**For gliding**:
- **Mountain sites above fog**: Excellent! Crystal clear, smooth air, spectacular views
- **Plateau sites**: Unflyable - fog, no visibility, no thermals
- **Strategy**: Fly from mountain aerodromes (Sion, St. Auban, etc.)

**Duration**: Can last 1-2 weeks, but more typically 3-7 days

**End of anticyclone**: Usually ends when depression approaches from west or south

### 3. Barometric Swamp - Marais barométrique

**Frequency**: ~10-15% of summer days, rare in winter

**Synoptic setup**:
- **No clear pressure gradient**: Widely spaced, irregular isobars
- **Multiple weak lows or cols**: Region between high pressure systems
- **Slack pressure field**: Often between 1010-1015 hPa everywhere
- **No steering**: Weather systems move slowly or stall

**Air mass**: Often mixed or old, stagnant air

**Characteristics**:
- **Wind**: Very light and variable, sea breeze and mountain winds dominate
- **Clouds**: Depends on moisture and instability
  - If **humid and unstable**: Scattered to numerous Cu/Cb development
  - If **dry**: Few clouds, hazy
- **Weather**: **Unpredictable** - can change rapidly and locally
- **Thunderstorms**: High potential if air is humid and unstable
- **Diurnal variation**: Strong - morning vs afternoon very different

**Why thunderstorms?**

In a barometric swamp with **high humidity** and **strong surface heating**:
1. **No large-scale wind** to prevent cell development
2. **Lots of moisture** = fuel for storms
3. **Surface heating** creates strong instability
4. **Local triggers** (mountains, convergence zones) initiate cells
5. **Cells can become severe**: No wind shear to tear them apart

**For gliding**:
- **Morning**: Often calm, hazy, poor visibility
- **Midday**: Thermals develop, Cu start popping
- **Early afternoon**: **Excellent thermal soaring** if air not too humid
- **Late afternoon**: **DANGER** - Cb can develop rapidly and be severe
- **Strategy**: Fly early afternoon, land by 3-4 PM if humid and unstable

**Hazards**:
- **Unpredictability**: Cb can develop suddenly
- **Slow movement**: Storms don't move away quickly
- **Multiple cells**: Several Cb can form simultaneously
- **Severity**: Can be very intense (weak wind shear allows vertical development)

**Recognition on weather map**:
- Isobars far apart and irregular
- Little pattern to wind arrows (variable directions)
- Multiple small low pressure areas or "col" notation

**Duration**: Usually 1-3 days before pattern reorganizes

### 4. Cold Pool / Cut-Off Low - Goutte froide

**Frequency**: Rare (~2-5% of days), but significant when occurs

**Synoptic setup**:
- **Upper-level low** (500 hPa) becomes detached from main polar air
- **Cold air aloft** isolated in a "pool" (goutte = drop/pool)
- **Closed circulation** at upper levels
- **Cutoff** from main jet stream flow

**Formation**:
- Large amplitude wave in jet stream
- Trough pinches off
- Cold air pocket left behind, isolated

**Characteristics**:
- **Cold air aloft, warm surface** (in summer): **Very unstable**
- **Shower activity**: Widespread, can be heavy
- **Clouds**: Cumulus, Cumulonimbus
- **Duration**: Can persist for days (slow-moving)
- **Location**: Often stalls over same region

**Surface weather**:
- Cool temperatures (despite summer)
- Widespread showers and thunderstorms
- Poor predictability (where/when showers occur)
- Good visibility between showers

**For gliding**:
- **Very challenging**: Showers and Cb everywhere
- **Timing**: Flyable between shower activity
- **Risk**: Cb can develop overhead rapidly
- **Best strategy**: Wait for pattern to change

**Example**: November 14, 2022 (shown in slides)
- Cut-off low over Central Europe
- Brought unseasonal cold and snow to Alps
- Persistent for several days

**Why problematic?**
- **Slow movement**: No jet stream to move it along
- **Self-sustaining**: Cold aloft → instability → showers → evaporative cooling → maintains cold pool
- **Forecast difficulty**: Models struggle with timing/location of showers

### 5. Föhn Situations

While not a separate "general pattern," föhn deserves mention as a **special Alpine weather phenomenon**.

**Setup for North Föhn** (most common):
- High pressure over Mediterranean/Southern Europe
- Low pressure over Northern Europe
- **South-to-north pressure gradient** across Alps

**Result**: Strong south winds cross Alps from Italy into Switzerland

**Characteristics**:
- **Warm, dry wind** on north side of Alps
- **Clear skies**: "Föhn wall" (clouds on south side, clear on north)
- **Strong winds**: 40-80 km/h surface, stronger aloft
- **Temperature jump**: Can warm 10-15°C in hours
- **Excellent visibility**: Crystal clear air

**For gliding**:
- **Wave soaring**: Excellent! Lee waves downwind of ridges, can reach extreme altitudes (>8000m!)
- **Ridge soaring**: Very strong, but turbulent
- **Thermal soaring**: Destroyed by strong wind and inversions
- **Danger**: Severe turbulence, rotors, venturi effects in valleys

**Other föhn types**:
- **South Föhn**: Rare, north-to-south flow
- **Local föhn**: In individual valleys

## Practical Applications

### Pattern Recognition

**Learn to recognize patterns from**:
1. **Surface pressure map**: High/low positions, isobar spacing
2. **Upper-level map** (500 hPa): Trough/ridge positions
3. **Satellite image**: Cloud patterns
4. **Local observations**: Wind direction, cloud types

**Practice**:
- Check weather maps daily
- Compare forecast pattern to actual weather
- Build mental library of what each pattern brings

### Multi-Day Planning

**Use pattern forecasts** (available 5-10 days out):
- Plan trips around high-pressure periods
- Avoid travel during strong westerly flow (frequent fronts)
- Watch for pattern changes

**Example planning**:
- **Day 1-3**: Westerly, fronts passing → wait
- **Day 4-7**: High building → GO! Book accommodation
- **Day 8+**: Next low approaching → finish trip, head home

### Day-of-Flight Decisions

**Morning briefing**:
1. **Identify current pattern**: What map pattern do we have?
2. **Pattern forecast**: Will it change today?
3. **Pattern-specific hazards**: Cb in swamp? Föhn turbulence? Front arriving?
4. **Expected conditions**: Thermal strength, cloud base, visibility based on pattern
