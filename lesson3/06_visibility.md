# Visibility Dangers (VisibilitÃ©)

## Overview
[Visibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visibility) is the distance at which objects can be clearly seen. For glider pilots, reduced visibility is one of the most dangerous meteorological hazards, potentially leading to spatial disorientation, terrain collision, or inability to find suitable landing fields.

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Visibility directly affects flight safety:
- **VFR flight requires adequate visibility** - legal minimums must be met
- **Terrain avoidance** especially critical in mountainous areas
- **Landing field selection** - need to see and assess fields from distance
- **Collision avoidance** - must see other aircraft
- **Navigation** - visual references essential for gliders
- **No instruments for IMC** - gliders rely entirely on visual flight
- **Rapid changes** can trap pilots in deteriorating conditions

**Critical Point**: Unlike powered aircraft that can add throttle to climb above weather or divert to an alternate airport 100 km away, gliders have no engine. You are completely dependent on your glide ratio and must land within gliding distance of where you are right now. This makes visibility absolutely critical - if you can't see suitable landing fields ahead, you're in serious danger. A powered pilot might accept marginal visibility knowing they can climb or divert; a glider pilot must be more conservative because once visibility deteriorates, your options shrink to whatever you can still see from your current position.

## Causes of Reduced Visibility

### 1. [Fog and Mist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog) (Brouillard et brume)

**Fog** (Brouillard): Visibility < 1 km
**Mist** (Brume): Visibility 1-5 km

**Formation Mechanisms:**
- **Radiation fog**: Clear nights, light winds, moist air - ground cools, air reaches dew point
- **Advection fog**: Warm, moist air moves over cold surface (common in valleys)
- **Upslope fog**: Air forced up slope, cools adiabatically to dew point
- **Frontal fog**: Associated with warm fronts - rain falling into cold air

**Characteristics:**
- Most common in valleys and over water
- Often forms during night, may persist into morning
- Can develop rapidly as sun sets
- Burns off when sun warms surface - but timing is unpredictable

### 2. Low Cloud (Nuages bas)

**Stratus Clouds:**
- Layer clouds with low base (often 200-500m AGL)
- Common in stable air masses (high pressure, inversions)
- Bise conditions bring persistent stratus to Swiss Plateau
- Can cover entire regions for days

**What this means**: Clouds aren't just "above" - in low stratus you may be flying IN the cloud, which is effectively IMC (zero visibility).

### 3. Precipitation (PrÃ©cipitations)

**Rain** (Pluie):
- Heavy rain significantly reduces visibility
- Windshield obscured, visibility can drop to < 1 km
- Precip shafts (slide 69) create localized areas of poor visibility

**Snow** (Neige):
- Even worse than rain - can reduce visibility to near-zero
- "Whiteout" conditions possible

**What this means**: That rain shower you see might look small, but inside it you could be effectively blind. Don't fly through precip hoping it's brief.

### 4. Haze (Brume sÃ¨che)

**[Atmospheric Haze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haze):**
- Fine particles suspended in air (dust, pollution, smoke)
- Reduces contrast and visibility
- Common in summer with high pressure
- Worse in industrial areas

**Characteristics:**
- Objects appear washed out, no defined horizon
- Difficult to judge distances
- Can make ridge lines "disappear"

### 5. Smoke and Dust

**Sources:**
- Forest fires (increasingly common in dry summers)
- Agricultural burning
- Saharan dust (occasional in Switzerland)

**Impact:**
- Can dramatically reduce visibility over large areas
- Usually associated with stable conditions

### 6. Whiteout Conditions (Conditions blanc)

**Winter Phenomenon** (slide 73):
- Low sun + snow-covered ground + overcast sky
- No visual references - ground and sky merge
- Cannot judge altitude, attitude, or distance
- **Extremely dangerous** - spatial disorientation almost guaranteed

**Critical**: This is one of the most dangerous visibility situations. Even experienced pilots cannot maintain control without visual references.

## Visibility in Mountains

**Special Challenges:**
- Clouds at mountain level create IMC even with good valley visibility
- Valleys can fill with fog while peaks are clear (or vice versa)
- Clouds can form rapidly on windward slopes
- Lenticular clouds and mountain wave clouds reduce visibility (slide 21-23, 69-73)

**Slide 23 Example**: Glider in reduced visibility conditions - note how terrain features become vague

## Flight Visibility vs. Meteorological Visibility

**Meteorological Visibility**: Measured at ground level, reported in METAR
**Flight Visibility**: What pilot actually sees from cockpit - can be different!

**Factors Affecting Flight Visibility:**
- Sun position (flying toward sun is worst)
- Canopy cleanliness and scratches
- Altitude (often better higher up, worse in valleys)
- Time of day (low sun angle reduces visibility)

## Legal Requirements (Switzerland)

**VFR Minimums (Below FL100):**
- Flight visibility: â‰¥ 5 km (day), â‰¥ 8 km in mountain areas
- Distance from clouds: Clear of clouds and in sight of surface
- Check current regulations - these can change

**What this means**: If visibility deteriorates below VFR minimums, you are no longer legal to fly - and more importantly, it's unsafe.

## Recognizing Deteriorating Visibility

**Warning Signs:**
- Horizon becomes less distinct
- Distant features become hazy or disappear
- Cloud bases lowering
- Mist forming in valleys
- Sun halos or decreased contrast
- You're squinting to see landmarks

**Progressive Nature**: Visibility often deteriorates gradually - easy to not notice until too late.

## Decision Making

**Before Flight:**
- Check METAR visibility reports
- Review webcams - do they show clear conditions?
- Check forecast - is visibility expected to decrease?
- Consider time of day - will visibility worsen (sunset, radiation fog)?

**During Flight:**
- Continuously assess visibility
- Have "alternate plan" if visibility decreases
- Don't continue into worsening conditions hoping it will improve
- Turn back early - don't wait until you're committed

**If Visibility Deteriorates:**
1. **Turn around immediately** if you can still see clear conditions behind
2. **Land ASAP** if visibility continues decreasing
3. **Never enter IMC** (clouds/fog) intentionally
4. **Fly toward better visibility** if you can identify where it is

## Common Mistakes

**"It Looks OK Ahead":**
- Visibility often appears better than it is when looking forward
- By the time you realize it's too poor, you're committed

**"I'll Just Fly Through This One Cloud/Rain Shower":**
- Inside might be zero visibility
- May be larger than it appears from outside
- Other traffic might be there too

**"I Need to Get Home":**
- "Get-home-itis" has killed many pilots
- Landing out in good visibility is far safer than pressing on in poor visibility

**"It Will Burn Off Soon":**
- Weather forecasts are not precise enough to time fog dissipation accurately
- Could take hours longer than expected

## Practical Examples

**Example 1 - Slide 69**: Glider flying with reduced visibility, ground features barely visible. This pilot should land immediately - this is already too low visibility for safe VFR flight.

**Example 2 - Slide 70**: View from glider cockpit showing very poor visibility - glider wing visible, but ground features extremely hazy. This is approaching IMC conditions.

**Example 3 - Slide 71**: Better visibility but note how distant terrain becomes indistinct. This is marginal for mountain flying.

**Example 4 - Slide 72**: Layer of haze over landscape reducing visibility of distant features. Common summer condition in high pressure.

**Example 5 - Slide 73**: Glider flying over snow with low visibility - whiteout risk. The ground and sky blend together making it very difficult to maintain attitude reference.

## Summary

**Key Principles:**
- Visibility is a flight-critical parameter - never compromise
- VFR flight requires good visibility - legal minimums are MINIMUMS, not targets
- Deteriorating visibility happens progressively - turn back early
- Don't fly into precipitation, fog, or low clouds
- Whiteout conditions are deadly - avoid completely
- When in doubt, land out - it's the safe choice

**The Rule**: If you're questioning whether visibility is adequate, it isn't. Land.
