# Lesson 3: Synoptic Meteorology and Aviation Weather Products

**Topic**: Understanding large-scale weather systems, frontal meteorology, Alpine weather phenomena, aviation hazards, and meteorological information sources

**Reference**: Météo Lesson 3 (Complete - Pages 1-133)

## Overview

Lesson 3 is the most comprehensive meteorology lesson, taking you from understanding global weather patterns to interpreting detailed aviation weather products. This is where theory meets practice: you'll learn to read weather maps, decode METARs and TAFs, identify aviation hazards, and make informed go/no-go decisions.

While Lessons 1 and 2 taught you about atmospheric basics, thermodynamics, and clouds, **Lesson 3 teaches you to read weather maps, predict how weather will evolve, recognize dangerous situations, and obtain the information you need** for safe flight operations. This is the most practical and exam-relevant lesson in the meteorology curriculum.

**Lesson 3 is organized into three main sections**:

### Part 1: Synoptic Meteorology (Files 01-04)
Understanding the big picture - air masses, fronts, and weather patterns that determine day-to-day weather across Europe

### Part 2: Alpine Weather and Aviation Hazards (Files 05-10)
Special Alpine phenomena (föhn, bise), and critical aviation hazards (visibility, icing, turbulence, wind shear, thunderstorms)

### Part 3: Meteorological Information (Files 11-17)
How to obtain and interpret weather information - METAR, TAF, weather charts, GAFOR, and specialized products

## Key Concepts for Glider Pilots

### The Big Picture

**Weather in mid-latitudes** (like Switzerland) is driven by:
1. **Temperature contrast** between poles and tropics
2. **Earth's rotation** (Coriolis effect)
3. **Result**: The polar front, where cold and warm air masses battle

**Most of our weather** comes from:
- Depressions forming along the polar front (over Atlantic)
- Moving west-to-east across Europe (steered by jet stream)
- Bringing sequences of fronts (warm → cold → occlusion)
- Followed by ridges of high pressure
- Cycle repeats every 3-7 days

### Understanding the Flow

```
Atlantic Ocean → Frontal systems → Switzerland → Eastern Europe

Typical sequence:
Day 1-2: Ridge/high pressure (good flying)
Day 3: Warm front approaches (clouds thicken, flying ends)
Day 4: Warm front passes, cold front approaches (no flying)
Day 5: Cold front passes (no flying until it clears)
Day 6-7: Traîne (excellent flying!)
Day 8: Ridge builds again...
```

### The Three Critical Numbers (Reminder from Lesson 2)

Still relevant for understanding frontal weather:
1. **-1°C/100m**: Dry adiabatic lapse rate (below cloud base)
2. **-0.6°C/100m**: Saturated adiabatic lapse rate (in clouds)
3. **Cloud base = (T - Td) / 2.5 × 1000 ft** or **(T - Td) × 125m**: Quick cloud base estimation

### New Critical Knowledge

**Frontal speeds**:
- Warm front: 15-30 km/h
- Cold front: 30-60 km/h
- Calculate arrival time: Distance to front (km) ÷ Speed (km/h) = Hours

**Air mass frequencies** (know the top 3):
1. West: 30% - Maritime Polar (changeable, humid)
2. Northwest: 22% - Arctic/Polar (cold, showers)
3. Southwest: 18% - Tropical (warm, potentially thundery)

**Weather patterns** (recognize on maps):
- Westerly flow: Most common, isobars W-E
- Anticyclone: Concentric isobars around H
- Swamp: Irregular, widely-spaced isobars

## Reading the Sky and Maps

### Cloud Sequences Tell the Story

**Warm front approaching**:
```
Ci → Cs → As → Ns → Rain → St
(24h)  (12h)  (6h)  (front)  (after)
```
When you see Cirrus thickening to Cirrostratus: Front is 12-24 hours away

**Cold front approaching**:
```
Cu → Ac/As → Cb line → Showers → Cu → Clear
(warm sector) (ahead)  (at front) (traîne)  (clearing)
```
When you see Cb line on western horizon: Front is <1-2 hours away - LAND NOW!

### Weather Map Reading

**Essential skills**:
1. **Find the low**: Look for L, closed isobars, fronts
2. **Locate Switzerland**: Where are we relative to the system?
3. **Identify fronts**: Warm (red/semicircles), Cold (blue/triangles)
4. **Estimate movement**: Distance and speed calculation
5. **Predict sequence**: What will we get first?

**Example interpretation**:
- Low over Ireland, 990 hPa
- Cold front 500 km west of Switzerland
- Moving at ~40 km/h
- **Forecast**: Cold front arrives in ~12 hours
- **Action**: Can fly today, but monitor; no flying tomorrow morning

## Practical Applications

### Morning Weather Briefing

**Part 1 knowledge lets you answer**:
1. **What synoptic pattern do we have?**
   - Westerly flow / Anticyclone / Swamp / Other?
2. **What air mass are we in?**
   - Polar / Tropical / Maritime / Continental?
3. **Are any fronts approaching?**
   - Type? Distance? Speed? Arrival time?
4. **What's the forecast pattern evolution?**
   - Will pattern change today/tomorrow?
5. **What does this mean for soaring?**
   - Thermal strength / Cloud base / Hazards / Duration

### Flight Planning

**Good flying days** (from Part 1 knowledge):
- **High pressure** (anticyclone): Especially in summer
- **Traîne** (post-cold-front): Often excellent! Cu, strong thermals
- **Ridge** (between systems): Brief but can be very good
- **Warm sector** (ahead of cold front): Can be good but time-limited

**Poor/dangerous flying days**:
- **Ahead of warm front**: Lowering clouds, approaching rain
- **At any front**: Precipitation, low clouds, wind shear
- **Barometric swamp** (if humid): Thunderstorm risk
- **Winter anticyclone** (on plateau): Fog, stratus, inversion

### Multi-Day Trip Planning

**Use synoptic forecasts**:
1. Check 5-7 day pattern forecast
2. Identify high-pressure periods (2-4 day windows)
3. Avoid weeks with persistent westerly flow (frequent fronts)
4. Best periods: After cold front passage, before next warm front

**Example trip planning**:
- **Monday-Wednesday**: Westerly flow, several fronts → Stay home
- **Thursday-Sunday**: High pressure building and established → GO!
- **Following Monday**: Next low approaching → Travel home day

**From Lesson 2** (Thermodynamics):
- Cloud formation - now in frontal context (Ns, Cb, etc.) and reported in METAR/TAF
- Stability/instability - determines stable vs. unstable fronts, thunderstorm potential
- Adiabatic processes - still active in frontal uplift, föhn effects, and mountain flying

**To Practical Flying**:
- Pre-flight weather briefing becomes second nature
- Reading weather maps and forecasts for cross-country planning
- Making go/no-go decisions based on comprehensive weather information

## Advanced Concepts

### The Jet Stream Connection

The **polar jet stream** (~9-12 km altitude, 200-400 km/h winds):
- Flows along the polar front
- **Guides** surface depressions (they follow the jet)
- **Upper-level maps** (500 hPa) show jet position
- Forecast strategy: Where jet goes, lows follow

**Rossby waves**:
- The jet stream meanders (north-south waves)
- **Trough** (jet dips south) = low pressure at surface
- **Ridge** (jet bulges north) = high pressure at surface
- These waves move slowly east → predictable pattern evolution

### Air Mass Transformation

**Key principle**: Air masses change as they travel

**Example journey** (maritime Polar air):
1. **Origin** (North Atlantic): Cold, very humid
2. **Ireland** (over cool ocean): Humid, forming St/Sc, drizzle
3. **France** (over land, heated): Warming, drying, forming Cu
4. **Switzerland** (further heated): Warm enough for good thermals, less humid

**For gliding**: "Day 3" of an air mass (after transformation) often better than "Day 1"

### Secondary Cyclogenesis

**Family of depressions**:
- Primary low forms on polar front
- **Secondary low** forms on primary's trailing cold front
- Sometimes secondary becomes stronger than primary!
- Can extend unsettled weather by 2-3 days

**Recognition**: Look for small low on cold front on weather map

### Preferred Tracks

**Depressions follow preferred paths**:
1. **Iceland Low track**: Toward Iceland/Norway (most common)
2. **Central European track**: Across southern UK/Northern France/Germany
3. **Mediterranean track**: Across southern France/Northern Italy (less common)

**For Switzerland**: Track #2 usually brings most weather; Track #1 often just brings traîne

## Exam Preparation

### Key Facts to Memorize

**Air mass frequencies**:
- West: 30%, Northwest: 22%, Southwest: 18%

**Front characteristics**:

| Feature | Warm Front | Cold Front |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Slope | Gentle (1:100-300) | Steep (1:50-100) |
| Width | 100-1000 km | ~100 km |
| Speed | 15-30 km/h | 30-60 km/h |
| Clouds | Ci, Cs, As, Ns, St | Ac, As, Cb, Cu |

**Traîne characteristics**:
- Behind cold front
- Cu/Cb clouds
- Showers
- Good visibility
- Often excellent soaring

**Barometric swamp thunderstorm recipe**:
- Weak pressure gradient (widely spaced isobars)
- Surface heating → instability
- High humidity → fuel
- = Thunderstorm potential

### Pattern Recognition Practice

**Given a weather map, can you identify**:
1. High and low pressure centers?
2. Front types and locations?
3. The synoptic pattern (westerly / anticyclone / swamp)?
4. Wind direction from isobars?
5. Expected weather for Switzerland?
