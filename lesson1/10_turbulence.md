# Turbulence

**üìñ Reference**: [Lesson 1 Slides - Turbulence](slides/meteo1_part-01-50.pdf#page=23)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Understanding turbulence is **critical for safety and performance**:
- **Recognize different types** - some useful (thermals!), some dangerous (rotors!)
- **Anticipate turbulence** - prepare before encountering it
- **Structural limits** - severe turbulence can damage aircraft
- **Passenger comfort** - manage turbulence for safe operations
- **Performance** - turbulence affects speed, reduces L/D ratio
- **Decision-making** - when to fly, when to land
- **Thermal soaring** = exploiting thermal turbulence for lift!

## What is Turbulence?

**[Turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence)** = Chaotic, irregular air motion with eddies and vortices

Contrast with **[laminar flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow)** = Smooth, organized airflow

**What this means**: Turbulence is random, swirling air movement. It creates bumps, jolts, and unpredictable motions in flight. Some turbulence is useable (thermals), some is just uncomfortable, and some is dangerous.

## Types of Turbulence

### 1. [Mechanical Turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence#Mechanical_turbulence) (Frottements)

**Cause**: Wind flowing over rough terrain and obstacles

**Characteristics**:
- Buildings, trees, hills, hangars create eddies downwind
- **Strongest near surface**, decreases with altitude
- **Proportional to wind speed** - 20 kt wind = much more turbulence than 5 kt
- Extends downwind 10-20x obstacle height
- Rotational eddies (horizontal axis vortices)

**What this means**:
- **Takeoff/landing hazard** - turbulence near runway from hangars, trees
- **Low-level flight** - avoid in strong winds
- **Rough ride** - uncomfortable but usually not dangerous
- Expect turbulence downwind of obstacles!

**Example**: 20m tall trees with 20 kt wind create turbulence extending 200-400m downwind and up to 60m high.

**How to handle**:
- Fly higher when possible
- Expect it on windy days
- Use extra airspeed on approach
- Be ready for sudden jolts

### 2. Thermal Turbulence (Convection)

**Cause**: Rising columns of warm air ([thermals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal)) and surrounding sinking air

**Characteristics**:
- Rising air (updrafts) 1-5+ m/s
- Sinking air between thermals 0.5-2 m/s
- **Bumpy but useable** for gliders!
- Indicated by **[cumulus clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_cloud)** (Cu)
- Stronger on hot, sunny days
- Irregular, chaotic edges

**What this means**:
- **This is the good turbulence!** - it's lift!
- Bumpy ride, but that's soaring
- Learn to center in thermals for maximum climb
- [Cu fractus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractus_cloud) (ragged cumulus) = active thermals

**How to use**:
- Circle in rising air
- Expect bumps at thermal edges
- Smooth core in center of strong thermals
- Avoid flying straight through - you'll miss the lift!

### 3. Orographic Turbulence (√âcoulement)

**Cause**: Wind interaction with mountains (see [Orographic Phenomena](09_orographic_phenomena.md))

**Characteristics**:
- **Rotor zones** = severe turbulence (see previous section)
- **Lee side** especially dangerous
- Wave-induced turbulence
- Can extend to high altitudes

**What this means**:
- **Dangerous turbulence** - can overstress aircraft
- See orographic phenomena section for details
- AVOID lee side of mountains in strong winds!

### 4. [Wind Shear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear) Turbulence

**Cause**: Rapid change in wind speed and/or direction over short distance

**Characteristics**:
- **Strong vertical wind gradient** (gradient de vent)
- Occurs at [jet streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream), [fronts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_front), [inversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology))
- Can be severe and invisible ("[clear air turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear-air_turbulence)" - CAT)
- Sudden airspeed changes
- Altitude changes

**What this means**:
- **Invisible hazard** - no visual warning
- Common in mountains (wind increases with altitude)
- At frontal boundaries (wind direction changes)
- At strong inversions (wind profile changes)

**Example**: Flying through inversion layer, wind changes from 5 kt to 25 kt in 100m ‚Üí sudden 20 kt airspeed change ‚Üí altitude loss or gain

**How to handle**:
- Maintain extra airspeed in known shear conditions
- Be ready for sudden changes
- Don't fly close to minimum speed
- Report severe cases to other pilots

### 5. Convective Turbulence - [Cumulonimbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_cloud) (Cb) Clouds

**Cause**: Extremely strong convection in thunderstorm clouds

**Characteristics**:
- **Extreme updrafts/downdrafts** (10-30+ m/s!)
- Can exceed aircraft structural limits
- [Hail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail), [lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning), [icing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_icing)
- Extends miles around visible cloud
- **DEADLY** - destroys aircraft

**What this means**:
- **NEVER fly near Cb clouds!**
- **Minimum distance: 5 nautical miles** (10 km)
- Even if it looks small, deadly turbulence extends far
- Can rip wings off aircraft

**Visual identification**:
- Towering vertical development
- Anvil-shaped top
- Dark base
- Lightning visible
- Heavy precipitation

### 6. [Wake Turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_turbulence) (Sillage)

**Cause**: Wingtip vortices from other aircraft

**Characteristics**:
- Strongest from heavy aircraft at slow speed (takeoff/landing)
- Descends ~300-500 ft/min
- Can persist 2-3 minutes
- Horizontal vortex pair

**What this means**:
- **Hazard during takeoff/landing** behind large aircraft
- Can roll small aircraft inverted!
- Stay above larger aircraft's flight path
- Wait 2-3 minutes before takeoff after heavy aircraft

**At gliderports**: Less concern (similar aircraft sizes), but still wait for previous glider's wake to clear

## Recognition - Reading the Sky

### Visual Clues:
- **Ragged cumulus** ([Cu fractus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractus_cloud)) ‚Üí active thermal turbulence (GOOD for soaring!)
- **Lenticular clouds** ‚Üí mountain wave system present, rotor below (DANGER on lee side)
- **Cumulonimbus** (Cb) ‚Üí extreme turbulence, AVOID BY MILES!
- **Dust devils** ‚Üí thermals touching ground
- **Leaves/grass moving** ‚Üí wind patterns show turbulence
- **Other gliders rocking** ‚Üí turbulence ahead

### Wind Clues:
- **Strong winds (20+ kt) + terrain** ‚Üí mechanical turbulence near ground
- **Hot day + cumulus development** ‚Üí thermal turbulence (good!)
- **Strong winds perpendicular to ridge** ‚Üí orographic turbulence/rotors
- **Changing wind direction** ‚Üí wind shear possible
- **Gusty winds** ‚Üí mechanical turbulence

### Weather Clues:
- **Frontal passage** ‚Üí wind shear, turbulence
- **Temperature inversion** ‚Üí wind shear at inversion level
- **F√∂hn conditions** ‚Üí severe mountain turbulence
- **Afternoon heating** ‚Üí maximum thermal turbulence

## Turbulence Intensity Scale

Aviation uses standard turbulence reporting:

- **Light**: Small bumps, no altitude change
- **Moderate**: Bumpy, some altitude variation, harder to control
- **Severe**: Violent bumps, large altitude changes, difficulty controlling aircraft
- **Extreme**: Aircraft impossible to control, structural damage possible

## Safety

### **AVOID**:
- ‚ùå **Cumulonimbus clouds (Cb)** - maintain **5+ NM separation!**
- ‚ùå **Rotor zones** lee of mountains in strong winds
- ‚ùå **Very strong wind conditions** (30+ kt) without mountain training
- ‚ùå **Flying with too much water ballast** in turbulent conditions (structural stress)
- ‚ùå **Low-level flight** in strong, gusty winds

### **PREPARE FOR**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Thermal turbulence on sunny days (expected, useable)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mechanical turbulence downwind of obstacles
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bumpy conditions at thermal boundaries

### **USE** (safely):
- ‚úì **Thermals for lift** - accept associated bumpiness, it's soaring!
- ‚úì **Wave lift** - stay away from rotors, work smooth wave lift
- ‚úì **Ridge lift** - expect turbulence on ridge edge

### **TECHNIQUE in Turbulence**:
1. **Slow to maneuvering speed** (Va) in severe turbulence
2. **Don't chase airspeed** - allow ¬±5-10 kt variation
3. **Don't chase altitude** - allow small variations
4. **Gentle control inputs** - don't fight every bump
5. **Secure loose items** - prevent injuries from flying objects
6. **Tighten harness** - stay secure in seat
7. **Focus on attitude**, not altitude/speed
8. **Exit severe turbulence** - turn away, land if necessary

### **REPORTING**:
- Report severe turbulence to other pilots (radio)
- Include: location, altitude, type, intensity
- Example: "Strong rotor turbulence 5 km south of airfield, 1500m, avoiding area"
