# Orographic Phenomena (Ph√©nom√®nes orographiques)

**üìñ Reference**: [Lesson 1 Slides - Orographic Phenomena](slides/meteo1_part-01-50.pdf#page=21)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Orographic effects are **essential knowledge for mountain flying**:
- **Slope lift** (ridge soaring) - free altitude gain!
- **Mountain waves** - can take you to stratospheric heights
- **Rotor turbulence** - extremely dangerous, can destroy aircraft
- **Foehn winds** - create severe turbulence and sudden weather changes
- **Understanding these phenomena** = safety in mountains
- **Alps flying** requires mastering orographic lift and avoiding dangers

## Wind-Terrain Interaction

When wind encounters [terrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orographic_lift) (mountains, hills), it creates various phenomena:

## 1. [Slope Lift / Ridge Lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_lift) (Ascendance de pente)

- Wind forced up windward slope (deflected upward by terrain)
- Creates **lifting air** for ridge soaring
- **Best with wind perpendicular to ridge** (90¬∞, or 70-110¬∞ acceptable)
- Extends **above ridge height** (typically 1-3x ridge height)
- Strength: typically 1-5 m/s depending on wind speed and slope angle

**What this means**:
- **Ridge soaring** = flying back and forth along a ridge in the lift band
- Need **minimum 10-15 kt wind** perpendicular to ridge
- Stronger wind = stronger lift (but also more turbulence!)
- Stay on **windward side** of ridge - lee side has sink and rotor!

**How to use**:
1. Approach ridge from windward side (upwind)
2. Fly parallel to ridge, staying in lift band
3. Turn away from slope (into wind) at ridge ends
4. Typical working height: 50-500m above ridge
5. **Never fly over ridge in strong winds** - rotor on lee side!

**Best conditions**:
- Wind 15-30 kt perpendicular to ridge
- Stable air (prevents thermals from disrupting ridge lift)
- Long, continuous ridge line
- West-facing ridges with westerly winds are classic in Alps

## 2. [Mountain Waves / Lee Waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_wave) (Ondes de ressaut)

- **Lee waves** form downwind of mountains
- Oscillating vertical motion (like water waves downstream of a rock)
- Can extend to **stratosphere** (30+ km altitude!)
- Identifiable by **[lenticular clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_cloud)** (nuages lenticulaires)

**What this means**: Air flowing over mountains creates standing waves on the lee side. These waves don't move - they're stationary relative to the terrain. Gliders can climb in the rising part of these waves to extreme altitudes!

### Wave Formation Requirements:
- **Strong wind** perpendicular to mountain barrier (20+ kt)
- **Increasing wind with altitude** (wind shear)
- **Stable air** (temperature inversion or stable layer)
- **Mountain barrier** tall enough (typically 500m+)

### Wave Characteristics:
- **Wavelength**: Distance between wave crests (typically 5-30 km)
  - Depends on wind speed and stability
- **Amplitude**: Vertical displacement (can be 1000+ m/s)
- **Multiple wave trains** possible (primary, secondary, tertiary waves)
- **Stationary** relative to ground

**What this means**: First wave is typically strongest, closest to mountain. Secondary waves get progressively weaker. In strong conditions, waves can extend 100+ km downwind!

### Wave Clouds:
- **[Lenticular clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_cloud)** (altocumulus lenticularis): Lens-shaped, mark wave crests
  - Air rises in wave ‚Üí cools ‚Üí water vapor condenses ‚Üí cloud forms
  - Air sinks ‚Üí warms ‚Üí cloud evaporates
  - Cloud appears stationary (but air flows through it!)
- **Rotor clouds**: Turbulent roll clouds in wave troughs (low level)
- **Cap cloud** (foehn wall): Cloud on mountain crest

**How to use waves**:
1. Identify lenticular clouds (wave markers)
2. Approach upwind of lenticulars
3. Find rising air (typically upwind of visible cloud)
4. Circle or fly figure-8s in lift
5. Climb can be 2-10+ m/s!
6. **Avoid rotor zone** (severe turbulence below wave)

**World records**: Wave soaring has taken gliders to 15,000+ meters (50,000+ feet)!

## 3. [Rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_wave#Rotor_cloud) / Lee Turbulence

- **Severe turbulence** in lee of mountains
- **Rotating horizontal vortex** (tumbling motion)
- Located in wave trough, below wave system
- **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS** for all aircraft
- Can overstress aircraft structure, cause loss of control

**What this means**: The rotor is a horizontal "tornado" of turbulent air below the wave. It's one of the most dangerous phenomena in aviation.

**Characteristics**:
- **Violent turbulence** - can exceed aircraft g-limits
- **Rapid altitude changes** (¬±10+ m/s)
- **Uncommanded rolls and pitches**
- Often marked by rotor cloud (ragged, rotating appearance)
- Can extend from surface to 3000m+ above ground

**Rotor warnings**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Strong winds (30+ kt) perpendicular to mountains** ‚Üí rotor likely on lee side
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Lenticular clouds** ‚Üí wave present ‚Üí rotor below
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rotor clouds** (low, ragged, rotating) ‚Üí AVOID!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Turbulence reports** from other aircraft ‚Üí stay clear!

**Safety rules**:
- **NEVER fly lee side of mountains in strong winds unless wave-trained**
- Maintain **significant altitude margin** above terrain
- Have **escape route** to windward (upwind) side
- If caught in rotor: **slow to maneuvering speed, wings level, ride it out**
- **Only experienced wave pilots** should intentionally fly near rotors

**At Bex**: Strong south f√∂hn winds create rotors on north side of Alps - AVOID!

**Safety story - Why rotors are deadly**: In the 1970s, a commercial airliner encountered severe rotor turbulence while approaching an airport near mountains during strong winds. The aircraft experienced vertical accelerations exceeding ¬±4g - the wings flexed so violently that the wingtips nearly touched each other! The aircraft barely survived, and several passengers were seriously injured despite being strapped in. Gliders, with their lightweight construction, are even more vulnerable. Rotor turbulence can impose loads that exceed the aircraft's design limits, leading to structural failure. This is not theoretical - gliders have been destroyed in rotors. The turbulence is so violent that pilots report being unable to read instruments, maintain control, or even stay in their seats properly. If you see lenticular clouds (wave markers) or experience sudden severe turbulence, immediately turn away from the mountains and fly toward the windward side. It's always better to land early than to continue into deteriorating conditions.

## 4. [Foehn / F√∂hn Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foehn_wind)

- Warm, dry wind descending lee side of mountains
- Air warms [adiabatically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process) during descent (~1¬∞C per 100m)
- Strong, gusty winds (can exceed 60 kt!)
- Can create severe turbulence and rotors

**What this means**: F√∂hn is a dramatic weather phenomenon that can rapidly change conditions.

**How f√∂hn works**:
1. Moist air approaches mountain from windward
2. Air rises, cools, water vapor condenses ‚Üí precipitation on windward side
3. Now-dry air crosses mountain
4. Air descends lee side, warms at dry adiabatic rate (faster than it cooled!)
5. Results in warm, dry, strong wind on lee side

**Characteristics**:
- **Temperature rise** of 10-20¬∞C possible in hours!
- **Humidity drop** - very dry air
- **Strong winds** - often 30-60+ kt
- **Clear skies** on lee side (f√∂hn arch - arc de f√∂hn)
- **Excellent visibility** (dry air, no haze)
- **Pressure drop** on lee side

**Effects at Bex**:
- **South f√∂hn**: Warm wind from south (over Alps, descending to Swiss plateau)
  - Temperature can jump from 5¬∞C to 20¬∞C in hours!
  - Strong, gusty south winds
  - **Dangerous flying** - severe turbulence, rotors
- **North f√∂hn**: Less common, affects south side of Alps

**Safety**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **F√∂hn conditions** = **NO FLYING** for inexperienced pilots!
- Severe turbulence, rotors, wind shear
- Difficult takeoffs and landings (strong, gusty crosswinds)
- Only fly in f√∂hn if **wave-trained and equipped** (oxygen, etc.)

**Positive aspects** (for experienced wave pilots):
- **Strong wave systems** often accompany f√∂hn
- Record altitude flights possible
- Spectacular lenticular clouds

## Safety Considerations

### **AVOID** (for inexperienced pilots):
- ‚ùå **Flying lee side of mountains in strong winds** (30+ kt)
- ‚ùå **Rotor areas** - severe turbulence can destroy aircraft
- ‚ùå **Low-level flight in mountain wave conditions** - sink can push you into terrain
- ‚ùå **Flying in f√∂hn conditions** without wave training
- ‚ùå **Crossing ridges perpendicular** in strong winds (rotor on lee side!)

### **RECOGNIZE** warning signs:
- ‚úì **Lenticular clouds** ‚Üí waves and rotors present
- ‚úì **Rotor clouds** (low, ragged, rotating) ‚Üí extreme danger nearby
- ‚úì **Strong winds + mountains** ‚Üí expect turbulence
- ‚úì **Cap clouds on summits** ‚Üí wave conditions
- ‚úì **Sudden temperature rise** ‚Üí possible f√∂hn developing

### **SAFE practices**:
- ‚úì **Check wind forecast** before mountain flying
- ‚úì **Maintain altitude margin** above terrain (1000m+ recommended)
- ‚úì **Have escape route** to windward side
- ‚úì **Start conservatively** - test conditions at safe altitude
- ‚úì **Get wave training** before attempting wave soaring
- ‚úì **Carry oxygen** for high-altitude wave flights
- ‚úì **Know your limits** - it's okay to land and wait for better conditions!

### **Emergency procedures**:
If caught in severe turbulence/rotor:
1. **Slow to maneuvering speed** (reduce structural stress)
2. **Wings level** - don't fight small altitude changes
3. **Gentle inputs** - don't aggravate situation
4. **Escape to windward** when able
5. **Declare emergency** if needed (radio Mayday)
