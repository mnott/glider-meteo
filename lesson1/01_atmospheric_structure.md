# Atmospheric Structure and Composition

## Overview
The [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth) is the layer of gases surrounding Earth that makes flight and weather phenomena possible. Understanding its structure is essential for safe gliding operations.

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Understanding atmospheric structure is fundamental because:
- **All gliding occurs in the troposphere** - you need to know the limits of your operating environment
- **Weather phenomena** (thermals, clouds, precipitation) only occur in the troposphere
- **Temperature and pressure changes** with altitude directly affect aircraft performance
- **Knowing the tropopause height** helps predict maximum thermal activity and cloud tops
- Different atmospheric layers have different stability characteristics affecting flight conditions

## Composition of the Atmosphere

The atmosphere consists of three main components:

### 1. Dry Air (Air sec)
- **78% [Nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen) (Nâ‚‚)** - Azote
- **21% [Oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen) (Oâ‚‚)** - OxygÃ¨ne
- **1%** Rare gases ([Argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon), etc.), [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) (COâ‚‚), and others - Gaz rares, dioxyde de carbone

**What this means**: The proportions of these gases remain remarkably constant up to about 80 km altitude. This stable composition is what allows life and flight to be possible. Nitrogen is inert (doesn't react), while oxygen supports combustion and respiration.

### 2. [Water Vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor) (Vapeur d'eau)
- **Hâ‚‚O in gaseous form** - invisible!
- Variable amount depending on location and weather conditions (0-4% of atmosphere)
- Critical for cloud formation and precipitation
- **Key for gliding**: Water vapor is the "fuel" for thermal convection and cloud development

**What this means**: Unlike dry air components, water vapor varies dramatically by location (desert vs. ocean) and altitude (decreases with height). When air rises and cools, water vapor condenses into visible clouds - this is essential for understanding soaring conditions.

### 3. [Aerosols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol) (AÃ©rosols)
- Dust particles - poussiÃ¨res
- Sand - sable
- Pollen - pollens
- Fine particles - particules fines
- Smoke - fumÃ©es

**What this means**: These tiny solid or liquid particles suspended in air serve as [condensation nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_condensation_nuclei) - without them, clouds couldn't form! They also affect visibility and can indicate air mass origins.

## Vertical Structure of the Atmosphere

The atmosphere is divided into layers based on [temperature profiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth#Principal_layers):

### [Troposphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere) (TroposphÃ¨re)
- **Extends from surface to ~8-18 km** (varies by latitude)
- **At our latitudes: 10-12 km thick**
- Temperature **decreases** with altitude at ~6.5Â°C per 100m ([lapse rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate))
- Contains ~80% of atmospheric mass
- **Where all weather phenomena occur**
- Top boundary: **[Tropopause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause)** (tropopause)

**What this means**: The troposphere is named from Greek "tropos" (turning/mixing) because air constantly mixes vertically here. The decreasing temperature with altitude creates instability - warm air at the surface rises through cooler air above, creating convection currents (thermals!). This is YOUR domain as a glider pilot.

**Why the tropopause matters**: The tropopause acts as a "lid" on the troposphere. Air cannot easily penetrate it, so cloud tops and thermal activity stop here. On a good soaring day, you might see cumulus clouds with flat tops at the tropopause level.

### [Stratosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere) (StratosphÃ¨re)
- Extends from tropopause to ~50 km
- Contains the [ozone layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer) (couche d'ozone)
- Temperature initially stable, then **increases** with altitude
- Very stable, little vertical mixing

**What this means**: Named from Latin "stratus" (layered), the stratosphere is very stable because temperature increases with altitude - warm air is already on top! This prevents vertical mixing. The ozone layer absorbs UV radiation, which is why temperature increases here.

### [Mesosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere) (MÃ©sosphÃ¨re)
- Extends from ~50-80 km
- Temperature decreases with altitude again
- Coldest temperatures in Earth's atmosphere (down to -90Â°C)

### [Thermosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere) (ThermosphÃ¨re)
- Above ~80 km
- Temperature increases significantly with altitude (up to 1500Â°C)
- Very low air density - molecules are far apart despite high temperature

## Key Points for Gliding

- **All gliding operations occur in the troposphere**
- The troposphere's thickness varies:
  - **~18 km at the equator** (warmer, more expansion)
  - **~8 km at the poles** (colder, less expansion)
  - **~10-12 km at mid-latitudes** (where most European gliding occurs)
- Weather phenomena (clouds, precipitation, turbulence) are confined to the troposphere

**Practical implications**:
- On summer days in Switzerland, you might climb in thermals to 3000-4000m altitude, still well within the troposphere
- The tropopause height tells you the theoretical maximum altitude for thermal soaring
- Higher tropopause (summer, lower latitudes) = more potential for high climbs
- Understanding that weather is confined to the troposphere helps you plan cross-country flights

## Questions & Answers

### Q1: Ã‰paisseur de la troposphÃ¨re Ã  nos latitudes?
**English**: What is the thickness of the troposphere at our latitudes?

**RÃ©ponse (FR)**: 10 Ã  12 km

**Answer (EN)**: 10 to 12 km

**Explanation**: At mid-latitudes (around 45-50Â°N where Switzerland is located), the troposphere extends from the surface to approximately 10-12 kilometers altitude. This is the layer where all weather occurs and where gliders operate.
