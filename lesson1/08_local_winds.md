# Local Winds (Vents locaux)

**üìñ Reference**: [Lesson 1 Slides - Local Winds](slides/meteo1_part-01-50.pdf#page=19)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Local winds are **crucial for operations at Bex and all mountain airfields**:
- **Predict wind direction** throughout the day without forecast
- **Timing of thermals** - valley winds must establish before good thermals
- **Ridge soaring** - afternoon valley winds enhance slope lift
- **Safety** - downslope winds in evening can be dangerous (wind shear, sink)
- **Cross-country planning** - valley winds help or hinder progress
- **Understanding local patterns** makes you a better pilot at your home field

## Valley and Mountain Breezes

Created by differential heating between slopes/valleys and free atmosphere. These are [thermally-driven local circulation patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_breeze_and_valley_breeze).

### Daytime: Upvalley / Upslope Breeze (Brise de vall√©e montante)

**Morning (8-11h)**:
- **Slopes warm faster** than valley air (direct sun exposure)
- Warm air rises along slopes ‚Üí **[upslope winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabatic_wind)** (anabatic)
- Typically 5-15 kt strength
- Creates weak thermals along slopes

**Afternoon (11h-18h)**:
- Valley air has warmed significantly
- Air flows **up-valley** toward heated mountain areas
- Strongest in afternoon (14-16h)
- Typically 10-20 kt strength

**At Bex specifically**: Wind from **North/Northwest** (from Rh√¥ne valley towards mountains/Alps)

**What this means**:
- Morning: Good for slope soaring on sun-facing slopes
- Afternoon: Strong upvalley wind + thermals = excellent soaring conditions!
- The upvalley wind actually enhances thermal strength

### Nighttime: Downvalley / Downslope Breeze (Brise de montagne descendante)

**Evening/Night**:
- Slopes cool faster by [radiative cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling)
- Cool air is denser ‚Üí sinks down slopes
- **[Downslope winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabatic_wind)** (katabatic winds)
- Cold air drains down valley like water
- Typically 5-15 kt strength

**At Bex specifically**: Wind from **South/Southeast** (from mountains/Alps towards Rh√¥ne valley)

**What this means**:
- Evening: **Dangerous flying conditions!**
  - Downdrafts from katabatic flow
  - Wind shear as cold air meets valley air
  - Turbulence at boundaries
- **Recommendation**: Land before evening transition starts!
- On calm, clear nights, this can create strong cold pools in valleys (frost in summer!)

## [Sea and Land Breezes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze)

Same physical principle as valley/mountain breezes, but with water/land temperature difference.

### Daytime: Sea Breeze (Brise de mer)
- **Land heats faster than water** (water has high heat capacity)
- Rising air over land ‚Üí low pressure over land
- **Wind blows from sea towards land**
- Develops late morning (10-11h)
- Strongest in afternoon (13-16h)
- Can penetrate 50+ km inland
- Typically 10-25 kt strength

**What this means**:
- Coastal areas: reliable afternoon wind from sea
- Can trigger convergence zones inland (good for thermals!)
- Often brings cooler, moister air ‚Üí may reduce thermal strength
- Can create sea breeze front with cumulus line

### Nighttime: Land Breeze (Brise de terre)
- **Land cools faster than water** (radiative cooling)
- Rising air over water ‚Üí low pressure over water
- **Wind blows from land towards sea**
- Weaker than sea breeze (typically 5-10 kt)
- Develops evening/night

**What this means**:
- Less important for gliding (we don't fly at night!)
- But affects early morning conditions
- Coastal fog can form when warm air over water meets cool land breeze

## Importance for Gliding

### Typical Day at Bex (Clear Summer Day):

**06:00-09:00**: Weak downslope winds ending
- Wait on ground or practice circuits only
- Thermals not yet established

**09:00-11:00**: Transition period
- Downslope winds weaken and reverse
- Upslope winds begin on sun-facing slopes
- First weak thermals appear
- **Good time to launch** and work slopes

**11:00-17:00**: Strong upvalley wind (NW)
- Best thermal conditions!
- Upvalley wind + thermals = strong, organized lift
- Ridge soaring excellent on western slopes
- Cross-country flying toward Alps favored

**17:00-19:00**: Transition to downslope
- Thermal activity weakens
- Winds become variable
- **Time to head home!**

**19:00+**: Downslope winds (SE) establish
- Dangerous flying conditions
- Sink, turbulence, wind shear
- **Do not fly!**

### Strategic Implications:
- **Morning**: Work sun-facing slopes, wait for upvalley wind
- **Afternoon**: Ridge soaring + thermals, cross-country toward mountains
- **Evening**: **Land before transition** - safety first!
- **Understanding local pattern** = better decision-making = safer flying

## Questions & Answers

### Q15: Par une belle journ√©e d'√©t√© √† Bex, direction du vent t√¥t le matin? Et en milieu d'apr√®s-midi?
**English**: On a beautiful summer day at Bex, wind direction early morning? And mid-afternoon?

**R√©ponse (FR)**:
1) Le matin: brise de montagne descendante (vent du sud/sud-est)
2) L'apr√®s-midi: brise de vall√©e montante (vent du nord/nord-ouest)

**Answer (EN)**:
1) Morning: downslope mountain breeze (wind from south/southeast)
2) Afternoon: upvalley breeze (wind from north/northwest)

### Q16: En bord de lac, dans quel sens souffle la brise en milieu d'apr√®s-midi?
**English**: At the lakeshore, which direction does the breeze blow mid-afternoon?

**R√©ponse (FR)**: Du lac vers la terre car de jour par une journ√©e ensoleill√©e, l'air au-dessus de la terre se r√©chauffe plus vite que l'air au-dessus du lac ‚Üí ascendance sur terre, aspirant l'air du lac vers la terre

**Answer (EN)**: From lake towards land because during a sunny day, the air above land warms faster than air above the lake ‚Üí updraft over land, drawing air from lake to land
