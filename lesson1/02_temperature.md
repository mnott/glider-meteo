# Temperature (TempÃ©rature)

**ðŸ“– Reference**: [Lesson 1 Slides - Temperature](slides/meteo1_part-01-50.pdf#page=5)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Temperature is crucial for soaring because:
- **Thermals form from temperature differences** - hot surfaces create rising air
- **Temperature affects air density** - hot air is less dense, affecting glider performance
- **Diurnal temperature cycle** determines when thermals start and stop
- **Temperature lapse rate** (how fast T decreases with altitude) determines atmospheric stability
- **Predicting thermal strength** requires understanding surface heating
- Cold temperatures can lead to density altitude problems at mountain airfields

## Temperature Units

Three main [temperature scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature#Scales) exist:

### [Celsius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius) (Â°C) - Most commonly used
- **0Â°C** = freezing point of water
- **100Â°C** = boiling point of water
- **Most common in aviation and meteorology**

**What this means**: Named after Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, this scale is intuitive for weather - you know 0Â°C means freezing conditions, important for icing considerations.

### [Fahrenheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit) (Â°F)
- Used primarily in the United States
- Conversion: Â°F = (Â°C Ã— 9/5) + 32
- Example: 15Â°C = 59Â°F

Here is a simple way to calculate between F and C:

- C=>F: Times 2, minus 10%, +32
- F=>C: -32, Divided by 2, +10%

#### Why Fahrenheit chose 32Â°: Daniel Fahrenheit originally set:

- **0Â°F**Â = coldest temperature he could create (salt-ice mixture)
- **32Â°F**Â = water freezing point
- **212Â°F**Â = water boiling point

#### Why 180 degrees instead of 100?

Fahrenheit wantedÂ **more precision**Â by usingÂ **smaller degree units**. He chose to divide the freezing-to-boiling range intoÂ **180 parts**Â instead of Celsius'sÂ **100 parts**.

**The math**:

- 180 Ã· 100 =Â **1.8**Â =Â **9/5**
- This is why the conversion factor is 9/5!
#### Why specifically 180?

This is speculation, but sound good: Fahrenheit liked the numberÂ **180**Â because:

- It divides evenly by many numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90...)
- Better for fractional measurements in his era
- More "resolution" between important temperatures

### [Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin) (K)
- Absolute temperature scale (no negative values)
- **0 K** = [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero) (-273.15Â°C) - lowest possible temperature
- **273 K** = 0Â°C
- **288 K** = 15Â°C (ISA sea level standard)
- Conversion: K = Â°C + 273

**What this means**: Kelvin is used in scientific calculations (like the ideal gas law) because it starts from absolute zero. You'll see it in ISA temperature references and physics formulas.

## Temperature Measurement

**Measurements are taken at 2 meters above ground level**

### Why 2 meters?
- Avoids direct influence of ground radiation (rayonnement du sol)
- Standardized height for consistent measurements worldwide
- Represents "air temperature" rather than surface temperature
- High enough to avoid ground effects, low enough to be practical

**What this means**: On a sunny day, the ground surface might be 40Â°C while the air at 2m is only 25Â°C. Weather stations measure at 2m so all readings are comparable. As a pilot, remember that thermals form from the HOT GROUND surface, not from the official temperature reading!

## Heat Transfer Methods

Temperature changes occur through four main [heat transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer) processes:

### 1. [Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation) (Rayonnement)
- Energy transfer through electromagnetic waves (no medium needed!)
- Sun heats Earth's surface via solar radiation
- Earth radiates heat back to atmosphere via infrared radiation

**What this means**: The sun's energy travels through the vacuum of space to warm the Earth. At night, the ground radiates heat back to space, cooling down. This day-night cycle drives thermal soaring!

### 2. [Conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction) (Conduction)
- Direct heat transfer through contact
- Air molecules touching warm ground heat up
- Less important for meteorology (air is poor conductor)

**What this means**: The thin layer of air directly touching a hot runway gets heated by conduction, then convection takes over to move that heat upward.

### 3. [Convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection) (Convection)
- Heat transfer through air movement
- Warm air rises, cool air sinks
- **Critical for glider pilots** - creates thermals!

**What this means**: This is THE most important heat transfer method for soaring! Hot air expands, becomes less dense, and rises as a thermal bubble or column. Cool air sinks to replace it, creating the circulation pattern you exploit for lift.

### 4. [Advection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advection) (Advection)
- Horizontal transport of warm or cold air masses by wind
- Example: warm, moist air from Mediterranean moving over colder surface
- Can trigger convection when warm air arrives over heated ground

**What this means**: Advection brings weather changes. A warm front means warm air is being advected into your area - this can strengthen or kill thermals depending on the situation.

## Temperature Variations

### [Diurnal Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_temperature_variation) (Cycle diurne)

**"Diurnal"**Â comes from the Latin word "diurnus" meaning "of the day" or "daily" (root: "dies" = day), so diurnal cycle refers to the daily pattern of temperature changes that occurs over a 24-hour period, with minimum temperatures typically around sunrise and maximum temperatures in mid-afternoon, making this daily rhythm critical for understanding when thermals develop and dissipate during each flying day.

- **Minimum temperature (Tmin)**: around sunrise (~6h)
- **Maximum temperature (Tmax)**: mid-afternoon (~14-15h), **NOT at solar noon**
  - Ground must first absorb solar energy, then heat the air
  - 2-3 hour lag between maximum solar radiation and maximum temperature
- **Thermal amplitude**: difference between Tmax and Tmin

**What this means**: The daily temperature cycle is critical for flight planning. Thermals typically start 2-3 hours after sunrise and peak in mid-afternoon. Understanding this cycle helps you decide when to launch!

**Practical example**: On a summer day at Bex:
- 06:00 - Minimum temp 12Â°C, no thermals yet
- 10:00 - Temperature rising to 20Â°C, weak thermals starting
- 14:00 - Maximum temp 28Â°C, strong thermals, best soaring
- 18:00 - Cooling to 23Â°C, thermals weakening, time to land

### Factors Affecting Diurnal Range:
- **Clear skies**: Large temperature range (might be 15Â°C difference)
  - Strong daytime heating
  - Strong nighttime cooling ([radiative cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling))
  - **Best for thermal soaring!**
- **Cloudy skies**: Small temperature range (might be only 5Â°C difference)
  - Clouds reflect solar radiation (less daytime heating)
  - Clouds trap infrared radiation (less nighttime cooling)
  - **Poor for thermal soaring**

**What this means**: Always check the forecast for cloud cover! A sunny day with large diurnal range produces strong thermals. An overcast day with small range means weak or no thermals.

### Seasonal Cycle (Cycle saisonnier)

- Earth's axial tilt creates seasons
- Sun's angle affects heating intensity
- Temperature lags behind solar radiation
  - Hottest months: July-August (Northern Hemisphere)
  - Coldest months: January-February (Northern Hemisphere)

**What this means for glider pilots**: Understanding seasonal temperature patterns is crucial for flight planning throughout the year. In Switzerland's soaring season (April-October), spring flights have weaker but consistent thermals, peak summer offers strongest thermals but thunderstorm risk, while early autumn provides the best combination of thermal strength with stable weather. The temperature lag means August can have stronger thermals than June despite shorter daylight hours because the ground has had months to warm up. This seasonal knowledge helps you plan cross-country flights and choose optimal flying days.

### Influence of Surface Type ([Albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo))

**Albedo**Â = The percentage of incoming solar radiation that a surfaceÂ **reflects back**Â rather than absorbs

**"Albedo"**Â comes fromÂ **Latin**:
- **"Albedo"**Â = "whiteness" or "white color"
- **Root**:Â **"Albus"**Â = "white"

**Scale**: 0.0 (perfect absorber) to 1.0 (perfect reflector), often expressed as percentage

- **Dark surfaces** (asphalt, plowed fields): Low albedo, absorb more heat, warm faster
- **Light surfaces** (snow, sand): High albedo, reflect more heat, warm less
- **Water bodies**: Warm and cool slowly (high heat capacity)
- **Vegetation**: Moderate temperatures through [evapotranspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evapotranspiration)

**What this means for finding thermals**:
- **Asphalt parking lots, plowed fields, rock faces**: Excellent thermal triggers!
- **Forests**: Moderate heating, often mark edges of thermals
- **Lakes**: Poor thermal sources (water heats slowly)
- **Snow fields**: Avoid! They cool the air, creating sink

So when you seeÂ **white/light surfaces**Â while flying, remember the LatinÂ **"albus"**Â - they're reflecting most of the sun's energy away instead of creating the heat you need for thermals!

**Thermal trigger strategy**: Look for dark surfaces under sunny skies - that's where thermals form first and strongest!

**Practical thermal hunting**: On a typical soaring day at Bex, experienced pilots watch for specific thermal triggers. The large parking lot at the base warms quickly in morning sun - often the first thermal of the day releases here around 10:30. The south-facing rock faces on the mountain slopes are another reliable source, especially in afternoon when they've had hours of solar heating. In contrast, the RhÃ´ne river and vegetated areas stay cool and are poor thermal sources. By understanding surface heating, you can predict where to find lift rather than randomly searching the sky. On cross-country flights, choosing your route over darker terrain (towns, industrial areas, plowed fields) versus green forests or water bodies can mean the difference between a successful flight and an early land-out!
