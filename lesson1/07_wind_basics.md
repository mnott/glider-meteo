# Wind - Basics (Vent)

**ðŸ“– Reference**: [Lesson 1 Slides - Wind](slides/meteo1_part-01-50.pdf#page=17)

## Why This Matters for Glider Pilots

Understanding wind is essential because:
- **Groundspeed** = Airspeed Â± Wind component - affects navigation and fuel/time planning
- **Crosswinds** affect takeoff and landing safety
- **Headwinds/tailwinds** determine if you can make it home!
- **Wind strength** indicates potential turbulence
- **Wind direction** helps predict thermal activity and wave conditions
- **Ridge soaring** requires perpendicular wind to ridges
- **Weather prediction** - wind patterns indicate approaching fronts

## What is Wind?

**[Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind) is the movement of air from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.**

**What this means**: Nature tries to equalize pressure differences. Air flows from high to low pressure zones, creating wind. The stronger the pressure difference, the stronger the wind!

## Wind Direction and Speed

### Direction
- **Wind direction** = where the wind is **coming FROM** (not going to!)
- Expressed in degrees (magnetic or true north)
- **360Â° / 000Â°** = North wind (coming from north)
- **090Â°** = East wind (coming from east)
- **180Â°** = South wind (coming from south)
- **270Â°** = West wind (coming from west)

**What this means**: A "270Â° wind" means wind FROM the west (blowing TOWARD the east). This can be confusing at first - remember, it's where the wind comes FROM, like an arrow pointing at you!

**Mnemonic**: Think of it as "the wind's home address" - where it came from.

### Speed
- Measured in **[knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)) (kt)** - nautical miles per hour
- **1 kt â‰ˆ 2 km/h â‰ˆ 0.5 m/s**
- Quick conversion: **10 kt = 20 km/h = 5 m/s**

**What this means**:
- Light wind: 5-10 kt (10-20 km/h)
- Moderate wind: 15-25 kt (30-50 km/h)
- Strong wind: 30+ kt (60+ km/h) - challenging for gliding!

### [Wind Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_model#Wind) (used on weather charts)
- **5 kt**: Short barb (half flag)
- **10 kt**: Long barb (full flag)
- **50 kt**: Filled triangle (pennant)
- Add them up! Example: Triangle + 2 long barbs = 50 + 10 + 10 = 70 kt

**What this means**: Learning to read wind barbs lets you quickly interpret wind strength on weather charts - essential skill for pre-flight planning!

### Measurement
- Measured at **10 meters above ground** (standard height)
- Using **[anemometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemometer)** (anÃ©momÃ¨tre)
- At airports: measured at runway level

**What this means**: Wind at 10m is stronger than at surface (friction layer). When you hear "wind 10 kt," that's at 10m. At altitude, wind is typically stronger - no friction!

## Origin of Wind

Three forces determine wind:

### 1. Primary Force: [Pressure Gradient Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure-gradient_force)
Air flows from **high pressure â†’ low pressure**

**Stronger pressure gradient = Stronger winds**

**What this means**: Look at isobars on a weather map. Closely spaced isobars = steep pressure gradient = strong winds. Widely spaced isobars = gentle gradient = light winds.

### 2. [Coriolis Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force)
- Deflects wind **to the right** in Northern Hemisphere
- Deflects wind **to the left** in Southern Hemisphere
- Creates rotation around pressure systems
- **Zero at the equator**, strongest at poles
- Only significant for large-scale winds (not relevant for thermals!)

**What this means**: This is why winds circle around high/low pressure systems instead of flowing straight from high to low. It's an apparent force caused by Earth's rotation. Without Coriolis, winds would flow perpendicular to isobars. With Coriolis, they flow roughly parallel to isobars aloft.

**Remember**: [Buys Ballot's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buys_Ballot%27s_law) - In Northern Hemisphere, if you stand with your back to the wind, low pressure is on your left!

**Practical application of Buys Ballot's Law**: You can use this principle in flight to understand weather systems without any instruments! Imagine you're flying and notice the wind has shifted from southwest to west during your flight. Using Buys Ballot's Law: face opposite the wind (face northeast since wind is from southwest), and low pressure is on your left (to the north). If the wind shifts to westerly, face east, low pressure is still on your left (now also to the north). This clockwise wind shift (backing) indicates a low pressure system is passing to your north. This tells you that weather is likely deteriorating to your north, and you might want to plan your flight to stay south of the low. Experienced cross-country pilots use this constantly to read the weather while airborne!

### 3. Surface Friction
- Slows wind near ground
- Creates [turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence)
- Reduces Coriolis effect â†’ wind crosses isobars at an angle
- Effect extends up to ~500-1000m (boundary layer)

**What this means**:
- **At surface**: Wind crosses isobars at 20-40Â° angle, flowing toward low pressure
- **At altitude** (above ~1000m): Wind flows almost parallel to isobars ([geostrophic wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostrophic_wind))
- **Implication**: Wind backs (shifts counter-clockwise) and weakens as you descend!

## Wind Around Pressure Systems

**Northern Hemisphere**:
- **[Anticyclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticyclone)** (High pressure):
  - **Clockwise rotation** (when viewed from above)
  - Air **descends** in center (subsidence)
  - Air **diverges outward** at surface
  - Generally light winds near center

- **[Cyclone / Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone)** (Low pressure):
  - **Counter-clockwise rotation** (when viewed from above)
  - Air **converges inward** at surface
  - Air **rises** in center (ascendance)
  - Generally stronger winds

**What this means**:
- You can determine pressure pattern from wind direction changes
- Shifting wind from south to west to north = low pressure passing to your south
- Steady wind from one direction = you're in stable high or between systems

**Mnemonic for Northern Hemisphere**:
- Lows: **C**ounter-clockwise = **C**yclone
- Highs: Clockwise = Anticyclone

**Southern Hemisphere**: Everything reverses! Lows rotate clockwise, highs counter-clockwise.
